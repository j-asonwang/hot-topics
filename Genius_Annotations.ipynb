(I’m avoiding the term “pro Palestinian” as that and its counterpart, “pro Israel”, have taken on unfortunate connotations of being mutually exclusive from one another.) Instead of Dershowitz (et al.) addressing some of these points, the typical counter-argument is that there’s an anti-Semitic bias in academia (under the questionable logic that being pro Palestinian renders one anti-Israel, which renders one anti-Semitic; I know).\\n\\nAt the time of this debate in November 2005, the anxiety about supposed academic anti-Semitism reached considerable heights, namely at Columbia University. A longtime vanguard of Arab intellectualism since the late scholar Edward Said, Columbia drew much scrutiny for the Palestinian sympathies of its leading Arab scholars, which spawned the controversial website Campus Watch to start listing  “dossiers” of professors with supposedly “anti-Israel sentiments”.\\n\\nHowever, after much controversy that the publicly listed dossiers were akin to a hysterical McCarthyist witch-hunt, they were taken down.',\n",

       " 4460250: ['With the song’s political undertones, there can be some interesting historical parallels drawn to these lyrics.\\nIn “the isolation ended”, we see perhaps a reference to the end of Japanese isolation by US gunboat diplomacy, which contributed to US-Japanese tensions culminating in the attack on Pearl Harbour and war in the Pacific.\\nThe “ping-pong match” may also relate to US-Asia relations, more specifically the “ping-pong diplomacy” practiced by President Nixon and Chairman Mao of China in the early 1970s that contributed to the resumption of US-Chinese trade.',\n",
       "  'These lines ironically represent the Diego Garcia island that’s full of airplanes and used as a military base, as “full of love” — but there’s also a double meaning, in that the sympathy could also be turning into love. A fellow-feeling is “an understanding or sympathy that you feel for another person because you have a shared experience”, adding onto the commentary about the collective hatred of Islam.',\n",

       "  \"This stanza describes conversation between a Jew and a Christian during which the Jew raises the fact that Jesus was Jewish to reconcile differences between Christianity and Judaism. Jesus broke with the strictly conservative Jews of his time, using his influence and following to spread ideas far more liberal than those espoused by his religion at the time. Given Ezra’s Jewish roots, he cites Jesus as having “broken his heart,” but contemplates a scenario in which the roles had been reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Throwing the pieces in the river” is a double entendre that refers to the Jewish practice of Taschlich, during which Jews throw pieces of bread into a river to repent for their sins. Claiming that Jesus would have repented for the sin of betrayal with a Jewish practice is another attempt in this song to reconcile the religions' differences.\",\n",
       "  'After this verse, it reveals itself to be a song both discussing love but in a deeper sense, beneath the surface, political and environmental upheaval. In this case it’s political – firstly, this seems to reference the relationship between Jewish people and Christians. They see each other as similar and sympathize with each other because they’re fighting against a common enemy they’re unfairly afraid of in Islam. Also “sympathizer” has historically negative connotations, usually used to label somebody who aligns themselves with a questionable ideology.',\n",
       "  'Possibly referencing Islamophobia. Jewish people and Christians were enemies until perhaps, Ezra argues, they became allies against the third Abrahamic religion Islam. It seems that he’s arguing that there is an unjust fear of people who practice Islam and this binds together the populations of Christian and Jewish people, many white and living in America.\\n“Never heard the words” might be placing himself as someone existing before this alliance, surprised to see once enemies now grouping themselves together.\\n\\nAlso maybe he’s speaking only to recent history here – Christians have treated Jews poorly for most of human history, but as time goes on it’s seemed that the two have pivoted towards their “common enemy” so to speak – this line, to me, points out the irony of bigotry directed at Muslims from Jews and Christians.',\n",
       "  'Ezra seems to be saying that in prior relationships he used to project himself upon other people. He’d, in his mind, inadvertently distort them to appear more like him. This is, possibly, a recurring motif from “White Sky” off Contra with “a pair of mirrors facing one another”. This also may very well be a reference to Kurt Vile’s “Pretty Pimpin” with his lyrics speaking of not “recogniz[ing] the man in the mirror”',\n",

Most electronic bands that don’t have drummers and do similar things to us fall into a certain sound, or have a certain vibe about them, and we feel that we’ve always held onto to a certain punk or soul vibe, at least in the heart of our music – there’s a heart to it that sets us apart from other drum machine bands.

And sometimes the show’s over and he stays on stage and keeps playing “Gigantic.”\\nWILLIAM CASHION: And I sing it sometimes. One time in Greenville, these people came on stage and played drums and guitar and were singing along.\\nSAM HERRING: Yeah, it was like 2:30 in the morning.\\nWILLIAM CASHION: The bar was really angry at us, and I just stayed on stage playing “Gigantic.” It was pretty fun.\\nSAM HERRING: That’s how we judge at a show, if William is really drunk, if he starts playing “Gigantic”.\\n(…)\\nWILLIAM CASHION: You can tell when Sam’s really drunk at shows because he falls down over everything and falls on-stage. And he talks too much.\\nSAM HERRING: That’s true, but it looks cool. And yeah, I talk way too much.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSAM HERRING: Yeah, I’m interested. When we were in Vermont, we had some time before a show and went to Lake Champlain. It was on one of our last tours with Adventure.\\nWILLIAM CASHION: It’s the largest lake made entirely of champagne.\\nSAM HERRING: They were like, “We just got the new Killers single,” and it sounded just like New Order. It wasn’t that bad. But once again, I was like “I hate The Killers!” I want somebody to give us some love like The Killers get love. If we had time, we could write a great album.',\n",

These sessions were recorded by Chester Endersby Gwazda as part of his junior-year final project. In January 2007, Allen Cordell shot and directed a music video for the song. This is the long overdue proper release of this classic Future Islands single.',\n",

Later that year, he ended up moving to Ashville, NC, with his girlfriend.\\n\\nHaving finished his degree, bassist William Cashion moved back to Raleigh, but keyboardist Gerrit Welmers and drummer Erick Murillo had remained in Greenville. In July 2007, the band gathered there to write and record their first album – Wave Like Home – with producer Chester Endersby Gwazda.\\n\\nIn November 2007, following a discussion with Sam Herring after an Halloween show, Erick Murillo left the Band. Later that year, bassist William Cashion would move to Baltimore. In Janurary 2008 he’d be joined by Herring and in mid 2008 Gerrit Welmers would finally move there as well.\\n\\nThe band started their first American tour in July 2008 and that Summer, their first album Wave Like Home would finally be released by British label Upset The Rhythm.'],\n",

According to an interview shortly after her breakup with Cave:\\n\\nEvery so often, she’ll become obsessed with something the sea throws up, and bring it back to her flat. ‘You load sown the mantelpiece and shelves with important pebbles until they buckle,’ she says. ‘But then, you realise why you were collecting them. You work out what they meant to you, and you don’t need them any more. You just don’t need them any more.’',\n",
       "  'The love affair turns sour. Listening to her voice on the phone, Cave can tell there’s something missing – it’s unspoken, but unmistakably clear.',\n",
       "  'From “The Secret Life of the Love Song”:\\n\\nI find quite often that the songs I write seem to know more about what is going on in my life than I do. I have pages and pages of fourth verses for this song written while the relationship was still sailing happily along. One such verse went:\\nThe Camellia, The Magnolia\\nHave such a pretty flower\\nAnd the bells of St. Mary’s\\nInform us of the hour\\nPretty words, Innocent words, unaware that any day the bottom would drop out of the whole thing.',\n",
       "  'From an interview with PJ Harvey:\\n\\nHarvey’s relationship with Cave is fascinating: she claims never to have felt so loved, and he was wild with grief when she left him. They broke up because it was too intense.',\n",
       "  'In his lecture “The Secret Life of the Love Song”, Cave sets out his notion that true love songs must contain sadness and longing.\\n\\nFrom the lecture:\\n\\nFar From Me took four months to write, which was the duration of the relationship it describes. The first verse was written in the first week of the affair and is full of all the heroic drama of new love as it describes the totality of feeling whilst acknowledging the potential for pain – for you I’m dying now. It sets the two lovers it describes against an uncaring world – a world that fucks everybody over – and brings in the notion of the physical distance suggested in the title.',\n",
       "  'Cave completely re-imagines this sentiment with a hint of sexuality in “Supernaturally”:\\n\\nThrough the windswept coastal trees\\nWhere the dead come rising from the sea\\nWith a teddy-bear clamped between her knees\\nShe says, where can my loverman be?\\n\\nIn fact, he often refers to a love interest as somewhat infantile or naive. Such as the girl with the ‘kitten’ in “As I Sat Sadly By her Side”:\\n\\nAs I sat sadly by her side\\nAt the window, through the glass\\nShe stroked a kitten in her lap\\nAnd we watched the world as it fell past\\nSoftly she spoke these words to me\\nAnd with brand new eyes, open wide\\nWe pressed our faces to the glass\\nAs I sat sadly by her side'],\n",

Catherine never treated me badly at all, it was me who broke up with her.',\n",

McCartney paid homage to their influence in the Anthology notes on Please Please Me. The hook of Cathy’s Clown directly inspired the vocal melody of that particular hit.\\n\\nSimon & Garfunkel also acknowledge the stylistic influences of the Brothers.

Archie Mitchell was the pastor of the Bly Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. He and his pregnant wife Elsie drove up to Gearhart Mountain with five of their Sunday school students (aged 11–14) to have a picnic. They had to stop at this spot near Bly, Oregon, due to construction and a road closing. Elsie and the children got out of the car at Bly, while Archie drove on to find a parking spot. As Elsie and the children looked for a good picnic spot, they saw a strange balloon lying on the ground. As the group approached the balloon, a bomb attached to it exploded, killing Elsie and all five children instantly.\\n\\nhttp://www.radiolab.org/story/fu-go/'],\n",

The greatest such impact was in English-speaking countries; the English scholar Thomas Hyde (1636–1703) was the first non-Persian to study him. The most influential of all was Edward FitzGerald (1809–83),[6] who made Khayyám the most famous poet of the East in the West through his celebrated translation and adaptations of Khayyám’s rather small number of quatrains (Persian: رباعیات\\u200e rubāʿiyāt) in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn The Prankster and the conspiracy, Gorightly says Kerry and Greg were interested in the poetry of OK.',\n",

He has a somewhat fresh take on Zen Buddhism.\\n\\n“There are two approaches to getting into Zen. The formal approach is to study with a Japanese Zen Master. The informal approach is an individual study program using whatever materials are available, what I call Western Zen.

The other half is sexual philosophy/politics influenced by the Kerista Commune (Brother Judd’s sect). Common Sense Tarot (another of the Cont of Five’s works) was the best tarot book I’ve ever read. It’s very interesting to see that quality of western and eastern esoterica out of one personality. [Camden] was pretty influential in how the original Discordian society manifested.\\n\\nThat said, if you read ZWZM, you should start with the knowledge that only about half the book is influenced by Zen practices (although it greatly clarified a few things for me), but it’s all mixed into the sexual philosophy/politics stuff.\\n\\nDo you get the feeling he’s about to smack you?\\nThe “Camp Meeker Cabal” which Benares lists under his name is probably a reference to Camp Meeker, California.\\n\\nBenares passed away in the year 2000.

The student has to go through the motions of enlightenment, motions which he will learn are paradoxically both necessary and irrelevant.

That a single hand could cause an uproar is a suitably zen contradiction, in that it subtly invites the reader to drop their preconceived notions.

       "  'Cram sez;\\n\\n“This page is the first appearance of the Sacred Chao. We’ll come back to the Chao, as it appears all over the Principia. For now, let’s look at the Nietzche quote.\\n\\nThe quote originates from the prologue of Nietzsche’s book Thus Spoke Zarathustra (which you can read here).\\n\\nWhat is a “dancing star”? The image of the star occurs a few times in Thus Spake Zarathustra, referring to destiny and divine purpose. The stars are fixed heavenly bodies which we use to navigate. But these times call for us to give birth to our own stars and constellations, to come up with our own reasons for living. Nietzsche loved dancing, he thought it was the most genuine expression of the human soul. In order to create great works, to be great people, we need passion and freedom. With an awareness of these things, we may give birth to our own set of values, our own dancing stars.\\n\\nNietzsche’s Zarathustra (whose name means “Gold Star”) wishes to free us from false dualities like good/bad and good/evil. Nietzsche thought our system of valuation is stuck, like a broken record, repeating the same dialog over and over again for the last two thousand years. If we accept these dualities as real, then we should be comfortable with the world they have created.\\n\\nBut Nietzsche asks “What’s next? And how do we get there?”  The answer lies in giving birth to our own stars, rather than accepting the framework that’s been passed down to us. The quote printed in the Principia occurs in this passage:\\n\\nIt is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ of his highest hope.\\n\\nStill is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow thereon.\\n\\nAlas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man — and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!\\n\\nI tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.\\n\\nAlas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself.\\n\\nLo! I show you THE LAST MAN.\\n\\n“What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?”— so asketh the last man and blinketh.\\n\\nThe earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.\\n\\n“We have discovered happiness”— say the last men, and blink thereby.\\n\\nThey have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth. One still loveth one’s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for one needeth warmth.\\n\\nTurning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!\\n\\nA little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much poison at last for a pleasant death.\\n\\nOne still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one.\\n\\nOne no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.\\n\\nNo shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.\\n\\n“Formerly all the world was insane,”— say the subtlest of them, and blink thereby.\\n\\nThey are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is no end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon reconciled — otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.\\n\\nThey have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health.\\n\\n“We have discovered happiness,”— say the last men, and blink thereby.\\n\\nPassion and freedom and poison: that is the invigorating but dangerous cocktail that we must drink to free us of the old moral systems. Zarathustra leads us beyond good and evil into postmodernity.\\n\\nThe Principia, with its emphasis on context, joy, re-appropriation, and self-generated meaning, establishes itself as a postmodern work. It holds our values at arms length, because they are little more than social constructs. Instead, it emphasizes the individual’s unique relationship with values and culture and identifies this as a potential avenue for new growth.\"\\n\\nhttp://23ae.com/2011/11/annotated-principia-discordia-page-10-the-sacred-chao/',\n",

Some people need this kind of guidance from above to make sense of the world.\\n\\nEris is not into this idea. She doesn’t think we need to keep passing forward this twisted and conflicted moral code from thousands of years ago. One of the problems with organized religions is that its adherents must internalize a bunch of conclusions that somebody else reached. They wrote down their conclusions, dressed them up in symbolism and mythological language, and told people that it’s the right way to live. If they made a mistake, or their conclusions aren’t relevant to the present day, it’s hard to roll back that dogma.\\n\\nFlash forward a few thousand years.

So he declared himself Emperor. Simple as that! After the transcontinental railroad was completed, people flocked to San Fransisco, where Norton was a local celebrity. Likenesses of the Emperor sold in gift shops. Restaurants sought out his seal of approval and displayed it proudly in their windows. His proclamations were printed in local newspapers, and he got away with issuing his own currency (which people seemed to think was a novelty item).\\n\\nThe world which Joshua Norton imagined was so much fun that other people wanted to live there too. Was he an Emperor or a madman? Either way – people treated him like he wanted to be treated. how did he accomplish this? How does one create a parallel universe?  Norton acted in a certain way, and his environment responded to it. This is a feedback loop, a point of interaction between the individual and the big picture. Norton encouraged and intensified the feedback loops that were a part of the world he wanted to live in. I imagine he ignored the feedback foreign to his universe, the people that treated him as dangerous, creepy, or took him too seriously.\\n\\nNorton didn’t try to destroy our world. He merely provided a superior alternative. People were drawn there to experience a little ecstatic madness. On this page, Norton says “Look, Comrade, you do your own thing and I’ll do mine!” This is a good lesson for all would-be revolutionaries. The revolution is about love, not destruction.\\n\\nWe can’t change the whole world, the Machine, the  System, the Network – it’s too big, and it has a lot of defense mechanisms. What we can do is change our environments, little by little, intensifying the parts that are already silly and wonderful.

Is that the best that humanity can do? Where did they get these ideas we’ve been chattering about for thousands of years? Can we come up with ideas that are just as good?\\n\\nAnd when the Greeks were laying down these tracks, they lived in a time that struggled to overcome Disorder. At that point in history, we’d spent millions of years living in Primal Chaos, living in tribal units and not writing down anything. Then we figured out the city thing, and entered the age of Discord. The Greeks discovered that with a little order, we could keep pull ourselves up into better forms of civilization. Their order was a triumph over millions of years of screaming and throwing rocks. They built something from the primal chaos. That’s why they saw Strife as a horrible old woman that you shouldn’t invite to your party.\\n\\nBut fast forward to 2012… Disorder doesn’t play the same role anymore. We’ve silenced the beasts outside the city walls, we’re all citizens and scholars now. And in this light, the danger is in our Order, our Bureaucracy. Now we need the Strife that used to be the wolf at our throats.\\n\\nIn this iteration of civilization, Eris wears a new dress. It’s not important that the Ancient Greeks feared her, we’re telling the New Story of Chaos now. The Ancient Greeks lived in a world where Order protected you from bad scary Disorder. And they protected that baby Order and fed it and cared for it, and now it’s out of control.

Those numbers are interpreted as a sign of Eris’ presence. On a long enough timeline, this will pretty much drive you insane. One constantly asks oneself: Is that just a coincidence, or is the universe trying to communicate something to me at this moment? Meditation on this question can lead to Robert Anton Wilson’s Chapel Perilous, or the Thelemic Abyss, where one faces the demon Chornonzon. The Law of 5s meditation is also sometimes compared with a moment of Kabbalistic enlightenment, where one experiences God by overwhelming oneself with life’s synchronicities and coincidences.\\n\\nConfirmation Bias is our tendency to focus on data which confirms or supports our existing beliefs, and discount data which doesn’t fit.\\n\\nRobert Anton Wilson posits that our brain contains a “thinker” and a “prover”, which do different jobs. The Thinker comes up with a conclusion, and then the Prover comes up with evidence and reasoning to support that conclusion. So we don’t come to a conclusion based on sound reasoning, it actually happens the other way around — the reasoning is a post-hoc justification for what we really want to say.

Breton was interested in what he called “surrealist automatism“, a creative process in which you draw material from your unconscious mind up to the surface. In automatic drawing, you rapidly sketch out whatever comes into your head, not really drawing with your rational mind. The little accidents and seemingly random markings are a window to the psyche. It can be surprising what lurks down there!\\n\\nThe juxtaposition of the occult note and the surrealist quote brings Austin Osman Spare to mind.  Spare was a contemporary of Breton, though I don’t know if they influenced each other. Spare was writer, artist, and self-styled magician. He laid down much of the foundation for what would become Chaos Magic, including signalization and automatic writing. The automatic writing process is nearly identical to Breton’s automatic drawing.

Since, as I am about to explain, the items found on this pine tree can symbolize the death of his aunt and a possible life thereafter, the pine tree can be said to bear his pine signs—that is, signs of pining, pining for his lost aunt.\\n\\nThe “empty emerald case, squat and frog-eyed, / Hugging the trunk,” is the exoskeleton of a cicada which has developed wings and taken flight. Since this insect, much like the butterfly, undergoes in its lifecycle a transformation that culminates in breaking out of a protective case and taking flight, in doing this it serves as a symbol of the soul’s departure of the body at the time of death.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s companion piece, a gum-logged ant”, is an ant that is inundated, as if waterlogged, by the oozy resin of the tree. Since “aunt” and “ant” are homonyms, this dead ant, which was prevented from moving just before it died, evokes the poet’s dead aunt Maud, who suffered from paralysis in her dying days: “We saw the angry flush / And torsion of paralysis assail / Her noble cheek.”\\n\\nWe have, then, symbols of paralysis, death, and an afterlife, all of which are encountered on a pine tree, and represent the poet’s pining.\\n\\nIt must be added—perhaps at the risk of critical interference—that amber’s remarkable power of preservation suggests to me a likeness between gum, memory, and art, of which I think Nabokov must’ve been aware when conceiving his poet’s encounter with the gum-logged ant on the day of Maud’s death.

       "  \"Facing the Azure Sky Expired: A Summary of Shade’s Final Moments\\n\\nFrom the meandering amusements of this final canto, it is difficult to discern just what a grand finale of artistic accomplishment has been achieved by the arrival of its final lines. To fully appreciate Nabokov’s triumph, the reader must glean information from all sections of this varied text and make connections crosswise. The resultant picture of Shade’s final day, along with the central signs and symbols found throughout the poem, must all be allowed to intermingle in the mind before a clean elucidation of Nabokov’s grand artistic achievements can be formulated.\\n\\nOn the last afternoon of his tragic life, Shade brings to an end his final stanza, limning his immediate scenery as he sits musing in his backyard arbour. The all-spent sun sinks slowly behind the horizon; a last-cast ray “attains Dr. Sutton’s last two windowpanes.” The neighbour’s gardener, who is seen pushing a wheelbarrow up a lane of trees and shrubbery, is a young black man hired by our deranged commentator, Professor V. Botkin, to tend to the garden at the Goldsworth estate while he is renting it temporarily on a teaching assignment. Botkin himself has just returned from the campus, having passed on his drive the poet’s wife who was on her way out to a club-meeting. As the gardener continues to work away, Shade accepts Botkin’s invitation to the Goldsworth home, where, in honour of his just-finished poem, couplets shall be read out loud and Tokay shall be tippled. As they make their way over, the two men notice the same butterfly—the Vanessa atalanta—which moments ago “wheels in the low sun, settles on the sand,” now land on the poet’s arm before fluttering off again, flashing its fire-like blacks and oranges as it circles round a laurel shrub. Finally reaching the Goldsworth lawn, they see an unfamiliar man standing on the porch ringing the doorbell. This man—we later find out from police reports—is Jack Grey (or Jacques D'argus), escapee from the Institute for the Criminally Insane, who has hitchhiked to the Goldsworth home to murder the judge responsible for his long-time incarceration. Spotting Shade on the lawn, he mistakes him for his adjudicator—they look alike—pulls out a pistol, and fires multiple shots until the gardener dashes over and delivers him a lusty blow with his spade, thereby knocking him to the ground and pistol-free. But the heroic act proves just too late, as the poet falls prone on the lawn, pierced by a fatal bullet, from whose perforation slowly emanates blood through his white cotton shirt. Moments later, as his future commentator has ducked away to stash the poem in a closet, the poet, now turned on his back, faces the azure sky expired.\\n\\nCoordinating Events and Making Ornaments of Accidents: Nabokov’s Art in the Final Scene\\n\\nAuguries of Death\\n\\nPenned within the penultimate minutes of the poet’s life, these lines confirm an augury that long ago was orchestrated. As he recalls in the first canto, Shade had, after having just turned eleven, a momentous mental collapse consisting, first, of “a sudden sunburst in my head,” then a blackout, and then an out-of-body experience, precisely in that order. This occurred when, lying prone in his childhood home, he was observing a clock-work toy—a two-dimensional tin representation of a black man pushing a wheelbarrow—work its way across the floor, passing multiple chair-legs before disappearing under a bedframe. From the commentary we learn that Shade kept this toy in his possession throughout his entire life, explaining, to the commentator who saw it in his basement, that he kept it as “a kind of memento mori.” Surely, however, he could never have known that, soon after turning sixty-one, and moments before his final collapse—that is, his death—he would see the sun flash against two windowpanes, and a black man, who was “pushing an empty barrow” up a lane of trees, disappear behind a nearby hedge. Neither could he have known that, being shot through the heart by a fatal bullet, he would land to die face down on the ground, mirroring that same attitude in which he experienced his collapse in his childhood.\\n\\nThe windowpanes reflecting the sun are “two” in number, perhaps because this nicely parallels the pair of eyes with which he experienced that “sunburst” in his boyhood. Admittedly, that might be a stretch. What is certain, however, is that windowpanes symbolize death, and likely even killers, since, in the poem’s opening metaphor, which is later repeated, a bird, to which the poet likens himself, is killed flying into a windowpane reflecting the azure sky. Moreover, Shade’s killer, Jack Grey, is in Kinbote’s fantasy “Jakob Gradus,” a member of a group of violent extremists based out of a Zemblan glass factory! Might it be of further significance that the sun flashes against the windowpanes of Dr. Sutton’s house, in particular? We have seen in the text that words are reversed or “twisted” in ways that sometimes contain information—as in “John son [of] Doctor Samuel” from “Doctor Samuel Johnson”, “Toilest” from “T.S. Eliot”, “Emblaze” from Zembla, and “Hades” from “Shade”. And here we find that “Sutton,” in reverse, is the phonetic equivalent of “Notice”! These observations, then, amount to overwhelming evidence that, moments before the poet is killed, the sun’s flashing against two of Dr. Sutton’s last two windowpanes is the enigmatic augury: This is a notice of Death! This is a notice of a killer!\\n\\nThe gardener, we are told, “admitted afterwards to a strange premonition which made [him] interrupt [his] work as [he] noticed [Shade and Botkin] from the shrubbery walking toward the porch where stood [the pistol-bearing intruder].” How magical! How magical to be symbolized in the all-clairvoyant daydreams of an unsuspecting child; how sublime it is for such phenomena to take place in this world; how uncanny for it to escape the notice of all its helpless denizens. It is all as if “fireflies were making decodable signals on behalf of stranded spirits, or that a bat was writing a legible tale of torture in the bruised and branded sky.”\\n\\nAuguries of Eternity\\n\\nAfter Shade’s observation of the sun’s flash against old Dr. Sutton’s last two windowpanes, and after his observation of the black gardener’s pushing a wheelbarrow up a lane of trees, he next observes a butterfly—one of the Vanessa atalanta variety—“wheel in the low sun, settle on the sand.” This, indeed, is an augury of the eternal and the afterlife. First, when this observation is made, the setting sun’s rays settle on the sand as if to highlight it, just as they had highlighted, moments ago, Dr. Sutton’s last two windowpanes in an act of revelation. Second, the butterfly is described as wheeling above the sand before settling on it. This detail should recall something that Shade, in his boyhood, used to delight in: “the miracle of a lemniscate left upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires,” described in the first canto. Even the choice of diction here, to “wheel,” is redolent of those bicycle tires, and suggests by association the exquisite lemniscate imprinted in the sand by them. Moreover, were a butterfly in flight to cut this symbol just above the sand, it would indeed have to “wheel” in the air in a figure-eight flight—etching in our poet’s lucid photographic memory an orange and black “ampersand” suggestive of the afterlife. As we have seen, this symbol is representative not only of the infinite, and therefore the eternal, but, in meteorological symbolism, it figures as the symbol for haze. This allows the poet to use the lemniscate to make references not only to his long obsession, the great beyond, but to his late and unfortunate daughter, Haze(l), whom he desperately hopes is now residing, “somewhere,” within that beyond. Finally, and most obviously, it is perfectly apt that a butterfly and not, say, a bird, should portend the afterlife, since the butterfly is, by nature, the result of a death in a previous form. This is precisely why the poet associates this insect with his daughter. We know from the text that Hazel suffered for being unsightly, and that, being ashamed and abandoned by a blind-date, she walked herself into a lake and drowned. As we have observed elsewhere, not only does her ugliness make apt the poet’s comparison of his daughter to a “woolly caterpillar,” but her particular method of suicide, and his hopes for her survival in the afterlife, especially do too. For, the caterpillar’s self-induced metamorphosis is, in a sense, a kind of suicide, and the subsequent sucking in of fluids to fill the abdomen of the prenatal butterfly is, in this context, evocative of drowning. Wonderfully, that this stored fluid is preparatory for the subsequent filling of the wings so that the butterfly can take flight, is highly suggestive of the exalted fate of Hazel’s soul in the afterlife.\\n\\nA Celebration of Eternal Lines\\n\\nSoon after ‘wheeling’ above the sun-splashed sand and highlighting eternity, the butterfly alights and “shows its ink-blue wingtips flecked with white”—a description which associates the creature to the craft of writing. This is a lovely little preamble to what is suggested moments later, when the atalanta alights again, this time on the poet’s sleeve—his writing arm, perhaps—then playfully takes off again to circle round a laurel shrub. Since the wreath of laurel was in ancient times conferred on a poet as a symbol of honour, this last act of the Vanessa atalanta can be taken as a celebration of the poet’s final, and ‘eternal’, lines.\\n\\nI feel obliged to add, in passing, that this butterfly’s prominent blacks and oranges make her, in the following metaphor, the potential counterpart to the burning scraps of index cards on which the poet wrote variants to his final stanzas. “As a rule,” the commentator informs us,\\n\\nShade destroyed drafts the moment he ceased to need them: well do I recall seeing him from my porch, on a brilliant morning, burning a whole stack of them in the pale fire of the incinerator before which he stood with bent head like an official mourner among the wind-borne black butterflies of that backyard auto-da-fe.\\n\\nThose charcoal-black, wind-borne scraps fluttering in tow and tumbling…. So distinctly do I see their orange edges scintillate, with quiet sparks, against the air that smokes and blows them.\\n\\nThe Vitreous Reflections of a Cerulean Sky\\n\\nAs we have explained, the azure is, in the opening metaphor, a symbol of the world beyond, and, more generally, of anything that seems beyond one’s reach. Hours before her suicide, the poet’s young unsightly daughter is abandoned by her blind-date, just steps before the bar in which their date was to take place. Romance being her great beyond, she “stood before the azure entrance,” through which she never ventured, jilted and ashamed. In the opening metaphor, the waxwing is killed crashing into a windowpane reflecting an “azure” sky. Ever seeking the world beyond, which might offer an afterlife, the poet likened himself to the waxwing. He differentiated himself on the grounds that, whereas the bird, in its striving, died, he “lived on, flew on in the reflected sky”, having had a vision of the great beyond when his heart stopped momentarily due to a strange, unfatal heart-attack. It is breathtaking, then, that, moments after being shot and killed, “the poor poet had now been turned over and lay with open dead eyes directed up at the sunny evening azure.” This is all remarkable for at least three reasons: First, by taking this supine attitude, his eyes, even in death, are made to look toward that azure about which he obsessed all his life. Second, having been killed due to a resemblance he bore to the killer’s intended target, the comparison between himself and the waxwing now gains an almost literal meaning: for now it is true that he and the bird are both killed due to a false resemblance, the one because a reflection resembled the sky, the other because he resembled an assassin’s target. Third, this gives much depth to Kinbote’s later insistence that “there remained to be written only one line of the poem (namely verse 1000) which would have been identical to line 1[.]” If this is right, the last five lines of the poem should read:\\n\\nAnd through the flowing shade and ebbing light\\nA man unheedful of the butterfly—\\nSome neighbour’s gardener, I guess—goes by\\nTrundling an empty barrow up the lane.\\nI was the shadow of the waxwing slain.\\n\\nThis suggestion provides the final lines with a perfect, rhyming denouement, since it caps them off by alluding to the death that they have been foreshadowing.\\n\\nLine 999 is an Old Friend of Mine\\n\\nBut could it be that the abrupt stoppage—at “Trundling an empty barrow up the lane”—was itself yet another augury? Was it to parallel the abrupt end of the very life that the poem was recounting? It seems to me that something of the sort is suggested, not only by the poem’s coming to an abrupt end, but also by ending on the particular line that it does. For, by ending at line 999, it seems to make an oblique reference to The Nature of Electricity, a poem published by the same poet, roughly a year before his death, in a publication called The Beau and the Butterfly. In that poem, Shade ponders whether the souls of the dead exist as electric currents:\\n\\nThe Dead, the gentle dead—who knows?—\\nIn tungsten filaments abide,\\nAnd on my bedside table glows\\nAnother man’s departed bride.\\n\\n(The bride might be the poet’s late daughter—a reference which would’ve been private between the poet and his wife. Recall that Hazel played “Mother Time” in her school play, and that the watchman who discovered her floating body on the night of her suicide was described by Shade as “Father Time”—who, unfortunately, “came too late.” If, then, Father and Mother Time are man and wife, Shade, in The Nature of Electricity, could well be imagining his poor dead girl, from within the filament of his bedside lamp, keeping him company and illumined.)\\n\\nAnd maybe Shakespeare floods a whole\\nTown with innumerable lights,\\nAnd Shelley’s incandescent soul\\nLures the pale moths of starless nights.\\nStreetlamps are numbered, and maybe\\nNumber nine-hundred-ninety-nine\\n(So brightly beaming through a tree\\nSo green) is an old friend of mine.\\n\\nTo repeat, Shade abruptly left off the writing of Pale Fire at line 999, without completing a rhyming couplet. That line, written moments before his death, makes reference to the actions of a nearby gardener, which reveal this man to be the counterpart to that clockwork toy that Shade kept, since his childhood, “as a kind of memento mori.” It seems, then, that this much-earlier description of a streetlamp numbered 999, the electricity of which is imagined to be “an old friend” of the poet, is an enigmatic augury of “a friend” who will be referenced in a line numbered 999, a year to come! The gardener is a “friend” because, moments after he is seen, he will try—alas in vain—to save the poet from being killed; and he is an “old” friend for being the counterpart to that clockwork toy that Shade has kept, since his childhood. Even the description of this streetlamp, “so brightly beaming through a tree so green,” draws us closer to that clockwork toy, which, moments before his childhood collapse, the poet saw “bypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed,” and closer still to that gardener who, moments before the poet’s death, is bypassing shrubbery and trees.\\n\\nNabokov’s Work from the “Involute Abode”\\n\\nOf course, although Shade could have fabricated all of those parallels and auguries that pertained to the death of his aunt, his marriage, and his daughter’s death, the same could not be true with respect to those parallels that pertained to his own death, since he could not have foreknown the particulars of his own end. The gardener and the clockwork toy; the sunshine flashing the windowpanes; the butterfly wheeling above the sand and circling round a laurel shrub; the reference of a previous poem to Pale Fire’s line 999; all of these “accidents,” and more, are made into “ornaments,” and beg for a cogent explanation. But, until strong textual evidence is amassed to show otherwise, the author or source of these orchestrations has to be Nabokov. Of course, for this assertion to be at all substantial and interesting, it cannot be meant in the trivial sense in which all authors orchestrate their own fictions. Rather, it is made non-trivial by the fact that the hero of this fictional world has himself caught onto his world’s artistic parallels and coincidences, and has conjectured for their source artistic beings who dwell in a realm entirely beyond his own—some “involute abode”—from which they busy themselves “playing a game of worlds […] making ornaments of accidents and possibilities” out of the stuff of his own world. Put differently, the protagonist has caught onto some of his world’s artistic parallels and coincidences, on the basis of which he has conjectured transcendent beings who, for their own aesthetic “pleasure,” orchestrate those parallels into “plexed artistry.” To be sure, it is an insane conjecture, born out of prolonged despair and suffering. Nevertheless, from our vantage point, we can see that it is true, for it is the literary artists of our world—Nabokov and his compeers—who satisfy this conjecture best.\",\n",
       "  'The ampersand is, of course, the symbol “&”, which is representative of the word “and”.\\n\\nTo liken the shape of a dropped rubber band to an ampersand is, we must admit, only a little amusing; but our amusement is elevated to artistic appreciation when we realize that this symbol is, in turn, a sort of lemniscate. As has been explained above, the lemniscate is a sidewise figure-eight, the mathematical symbol for infinity, and the meteorological symbol for haze, by which it has come in this poem to serve as the symbol for eternity, and the poet’s dead daughter, Hazel.\\n\\nEver since his experience of a visionary mental collapse in his childhood, Shade has been obsessed with questions of the great beyond, eternity, and the afterlife. He recalls, in the first canto, his boyhood delight at noticing “a lemniscate left upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires.” He falls in love with his wife during a school outing “in April’s haze,” and names their first child “Hazel”. His obsession with the great beyond comes to be felt with more urgency upon the death of his daughter, who suffered for lacking physical graces and eventually committed suicide. It is for these reasons, I think, that the poet likens his daughter’s life to a “woolly caterpillar,” which, after all, by a self-induced death, enjoys a second life in the beautiful form of a butterfly. In this light, it may dawn on the reader that the symbol for Hazel—the lemniscate—might also pass for a linear image of a butterfly, seen from either ventral or dorsal view. Moreover, it might likewise pass for an hourglass, an item which Shade is alluding to in his observation that,\\n\\nA thousand years ago five minutes were\\nEqual to forty ounces of fine sand.\\n\\nIt is sand that drops through an hourglass to count the passing of time; the poet delights in seeing, as a child, a lemniscate left upon wet sand; and, on his final day, the poet will see a flying butterfly which “wheels in the low sun [and] settles on the sand.”\\n\\nShade’s commentator will later recall that, moments before the poet’s death, as they made their way to be indoors to celebrate the completion of the poem,\\n\\nWith an inward leap of exultation I relieved him of the large envelope that hampered his movements as he descended the steps of the porch, sideways, like a hesitating infant. We crossed the lawn, we crossed the road. […] In the large envelope I carried I could feel the hard-cornered, rubberbanded batches of index cards [on which the poem was written.]\\n\\nThe poem’s central themes are the great beyond and the death of Hazel, and all this now seems symbolized by the author’s using a rubber band to hold together those index cards—a rubberband, “which always forms, when dropped, an ampersand.”\\n\\nI picture an infinite hourglass as an ampersand… ampersand… ambersand? … amber sand… grain of sand… drop the sand… and drop the sand… and drop the sand… and drop the sand….',\n",
       "  'A lovely continuation of the pun on “Chapman” above, where the direct reference was to a Chapman of baseball who crushed a ‘homer,’ and the indirect to a Chapman of poetry who translated Homer.\\n\\nSoon after this pun, we learn that the poet, in his boyhood, “never bounced a ball or swung a bat” but, nevertheless, “played with other chaps.”\\n\\nNow, the reader who has kept the pun in mind may interpret this to mean that, while the child didn’t play with Chapmans—that is, his athletic peers—he was able to play with other chaps—that is, his non-athletic peers. Another reading would be that these “other chaps” were not only non-athletic peers, but the other Chapmans, that is, peers who were, like him, literary. But, it is possible that what is being implied here is even more strict, namely, that while the other boys were out playing with their peers, he didn’t play with his peers at all, electing instead to ‘play’ with other Chapmans, as in read the poets.',\n",
       "  'In the game of horseshoes, a tossed horseshoe that leans against the post counts for two points. Here, the poet’s “click” and “clunk” indicate the success of the two tosses which constitute a given player’s turn. The particular positions in which both of these shoes finally settle is not conclusive, but we see that the poet imagines one shoe leaning against the stake, which he likens to a drunk man leaning against a lamppost. In an earlier poem, “The Nature of Electricity,” Shade ponders the possibility of souls residing in the filaments of lightbulbs, imagining one in a lamppost numbered 999, as harbouring the soul of “an old friend of mine.” This horseshoe, then, which rests against the “lamppost,” recalls a drunk man who is leaning on a friend; and since we know that Shade had a drinking problem, we may infer that this drunk man is he. —But who is the friend?\\n\\nAs we have observed elsewhere, this lamppost, “number nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine,” seems to make an oblique reference to Pale Fire’s line 999, written a year later, which in turn makes reference to a gardener who is going to try, alas in vain, to save the poet’s life, and who has clearly been presaged by a clockwork toy that the poet saw in his boyhood, moments before collapsing. It may be, then, that this metaphor of a friendly lamppost, may presage, without the poet’s intention, the gardener who, in moments to come, is a “friend” for trying to save him.\\n\\nFinally, since, in the game of horseshoes, the tossed shoes land in a pit of sand, perhaps the playing of this game just before the poet’s death is an allusion to the lemniscate—the sign for eternity—which, in the first canto, he recalls being “left upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires.” In fact, this is precisely the evocation made by the very next couplet, which describes a butterfly ‘wheeling’ in flight just above a patch of sand! It seems, then, that the game of horseshoes being played, moments before the poet’s death, might be yet another augury, not only of the poet’s imminent end, but also of the fate of his eternal soul.',\n",
       "  'Breathtaking auguries!\\n\\nDuring a fieldtrip in their high-school days, Shade’s heart is won by Sybil as they loaf recumbent on a patch of green. But on close inspection, we discern the sublime details that foretold of their future child and marriage:\\n\\n\\n“I reclined in April’s haze immediately behind your slender back and watched your neat small head bend to one side”: In years to come, they will conceive their only child, and her name will be Hazel. One prominent symbol in the poem is the lemniscate, a side-wise figure-eight, which stands not only for infinity and the afterlife, but is the meteorological symbol for haze. Could they have named her “Hazel”, then, in honour of that hazy day on which the poet fell in love with Sybil?\\n“One palm with fingers spread, between a star of trillium and a stone, pressed against the turf. A little phalange bone kept twitching”: Unbelievably beautiful, these are nature’s signs of the diamond ring in future matrimony. Her hand is pressed in the soft turf between a stone and a “star of trillium,” the name of a flower with pointed star-like petals; her fingers are spread, and one little “phalange” keeps “twitching” as if to draw attention to itself. Surely this was the marriage finger, twitching between a rock and ‘star’, as if to say, “Put a star-like rock on this finger, John!”\\n“Then you turned and offered me a thimbleful of bright metallic tea”: Again a symbol of a wedding band, this one offered to John by Sybil, during their future wedding ceremony. “Thimbleful” and “bright metallic” without question evoke something “bright” and “metallic” that fits on a finger, and so this is without question an oblique reference to the gold metal band that a groom is offered on his wedding day.\\n\\n\\n\\nExhausted by these rather circuitous and entirely unsuccessful attempts at communication, Nature finally breaks out into a whisper in the boy’s head: John?… John! Listen to me: You’re a clumsy, rounded fellow, I get it, “never bounced a ball or swung a bat” and all that; “asthmatic, lame and fat”, understood, but listen! This fetching young lady seems to like you, so you need to act on it and stop staring at lemniscates. …Yes she does! Trust me! …What?! I have a life-time planned for you, hurry the fuck up!',\n",
       "  \"Although what I am about to point out is only an amusement, gumshoe-readers, gripped by cryptography, might wish to pursue it further.\\n\\nIt has been pointed out–by a critic whose good name escapes me–that names and other expressions in Pale Fire are sometimes derived by others whose ends have been pinched–as the ends of a bowtie might be pinched by a dandy–and curled toward one another until they touch and form a pregnant circle.\\n\\nFor example, the surname of the poem’s Zemblan commentator, “Kinbote,” can be derived by curling the name of one of Shade’s rather obscure colleagues, “Botkin,” and then reading from the “k” in the necessary direction to get you “Kinbote.” (Yes, yes, the ‘e’ is extraneous, but the result is so suggestive that it warrants further prosecution.) Likewise, the surname of the alleged Zemblan assassin, “Gradus,” can be derived by curling one of his alleged aliases, “D'argus,” and reading from the “g” in the direction required to get “Gradus.” (The result is not exact but, again, very encouraging.)\\n\\nIn his comment to lines 347-348, Kinbote writes, “I am quite sure it was I who one day, when we were discussing ‘mirror words,’ observed (and I recall the poet’s expression of stupefaction) that ‘spider’ in reverse is ‘redips,’ and ’T.S. Eliot,‘ 'toilest’” (implying perhaps that Eliot must’ve toiled away to produce such turgid poetry.) Although both of these expressions are derived by a backwards spelling of their originals, they are also producible within the circular schema that we have just outlined.\\n\\nIn the commentary to line 894, we learn that John Shade was said to bear a physical resemblance to that 18th century monarch of English letters, Doctor Samuel Johnson. The reader at this point would already have learned–from the commentary to line 71–that John Shade was son to Samuel Shade, who in the same note is said to have “studied medicine in his youth.” But this is precisely the information derivable from the name of Shade’s physical predecessor, “Doctor Samuel Johnson”, when curled into a circle; for it gives us, “John son [of] Doctor Samuel.” This might furnish us with a happy reference to Johnson’s famous Dictionary of the English Language, in which an appropriate portion of a clairvoyant entry might have gone something like,\\n\\nShade, John Francis: 1898-1959, American poet and son of Doctor Samuel Shade, distinguished American ornithologist.\\n\\nInterestingly, Shade, who harboured a lifelong obsession with the afterlife, has a name which, when subjected to our schema, yields “Hades,” the name in Greek mythology given to that dark and gloomy realm where the souls, or ‘shades’, of all mortals were believed to go upon their death. Likewise, the name of that fictional kingdom, “Zembla,” of which the deluded commentator of Pale Fire believes himself to be former king, yields “emblaze”–that is, to illuminate or kindle, as by a blaze. This self-styled king-in-exile, Charles the Beloved, teaching in America under the name of Charles Kinbote, hopes more than anything that, by barraging his favourite poet and colleague with historical anecdotes, Zembla, its exiled king, and his great escape will function as the primary inspiration behind an upcoming masterpiece in heroic couplets. It is in this sense, then, that Zembla is to “emblaze;” it is to spark, it is to kindle, it is to inspire the writing of a poem which is to reflect, even if by a pale light, its brilliant fire.\\n\\nThis interpretation is corroborated by Kinbote’s diction when, remarking on the poem, he laments,\\n\\nAlthough I realize only too clearly, alas, that the result, in its pale and diaphanous final phase, cannot be regarded as a direct echo of my narrative […], one can hardly doubt that the sunset glow of the story acted as a catalytic agent upon the very process of the sustained creative effervescence that enabled Shade to produce a 1000-line poem in three weeks.\\n\\nAnd here, by Shade’s diction in the poem, when describing poetic inspiration:\\n\\nNow I shall speak… Better than any soap\\nIs the sensation for which poets hope\\nWhen inspiration and its icy blaze,\\nThe sudden image, the immediate phrase\\nOver the skin a triple ripple send\\nMaking the little hairs all stand on end\",\n",
       "  'Shade’s family and the tragedy that rocked it: these are the principle concerns of the second canto. We learn of the poet’s boyhood cogitations on mortality, and find him, in later years, regretting the lack of imagination in all the traditional conceptions of the afterlife. Turning then to his central theme, he first recalls his “bizarre aunt Maud,” an amateur artist and second mother who began to look after him when he was only a small boy. Her final days were sadly met with paralysis, madness, and the speech deterioration with which she struggled in a sanatorium until her death. He next reminisces over his wife in their younger days when he discovered his love for her, and recalls with a heavy heart the troubled existence of their only child, and that cold, ominous night on which she walked herself into a lake and drowned.\\n\\nThe canto teems with signs and symbols both artistic and portentous. During a fieldtrip in their high-school days Shade is touched by the beauty of his future wife as she loafs recumbent on a patch of green. Her hand, pressed against the soft turf, is flanked by a rock and a “star of trillium,” as if Nature were whispering: Place a star-like stone on her fingers, John.\\n\\nPine-signs: On the day of his aunt’s death the poet happens upon a pine tree on whose trunk is observed a “gum-logged ant,” the death of a thing forever paralyzed phonetically recalling “aunt”; on that same tree is an “empty emerald,” a green chrysalis whose vacancy reminds one, not only of death, but of a possible transmigration in the sequel. The pine tree? The pine tree bears his pine-signs, signs of pining, pining over his lost aunt.\\n\\nRegarding the tragedy of the poet’s only child ominous symbols abound: The recondite words for whose meanings she inquires quietly indicate her death; on the night of her grisly suicide omens occur when clocks point to her age; and the television programming viewed by her anxious parents as they await her return from a blind-date is eerily replete with covert references to her final act.\\n\\nThis tabulation is by no means comprehensive; but strikes me as too copious to be prolonged in this proem. I must, however, expatiate on the most significant symbol in the poem, one whose artistic perfection is realized in the final line of the present canto.\\n\\nThe lemniscate, a sidewise figure-eight, is both the mathematical symbol for infinity and the meteorological symbol for haze, allowing for numerous allusions to the poet’s daughter, Hazel, and to the great eternal beyond in which he yearns so desperately to find her. It also resembles, if only linearly, the outstretched wings of a butterfly, to which the structure of the poem might allude, being described by its Zemblan annotator as a thousand-line poem, with its two central cantos, identical in length, “solid and ample, forming together with the shorter flanks twin wings of five hundred verses each.” The wings he has in mind evidently are those of a bird, variants of which figure here and there throughout the poem. But what, like so much else, has escaped his notice, is the consummate symbolism achieved by having the four cantos represent, not four parts of two identical wings, but the two identical pairs of wings unfurled by the butterfly,\\n\\n\\n\\nspecies of which also figure throughout the poem, and, more importantly, represent a form of life-after-death. For it is by this added feature that the poem’s structure can reflect its main themes of life, death, and a possible existence thereafter.\\n\\nMoreover, that the death of Hazel is located at the very last line of the first half of the poem suddenly bursts with significance. We see that the first half of the poem dwells on the lives of the poet’s loved ones, while the second half focuses on the afterlife to which those loved ones may have passed. So, if the structure of the poem is a lemniscate, at the nexus of which we find a death, then its first volute represents life, its second volute the afterlife. This would suggest, quite poetically, that death is the pinch in life’s lemniscate, out of which one hopes to swerve to dwell again in a second volute. Since this is precisely the lifecycle of lepidoptera-as the caterpillar lives and dies only to be ‘reborn’ as a butterfly-it is all the more apt and lovely that the same symbol that represents Haze(l), infinity, and the structure of the poem, should at the same time represent a butterfly in flight, registering the poet’s hope for his daughter in the afterlife. Bolstering this interpretation, I think, is not only Hazel’s unsightliness as highlighted by her father and represented by the caterpillar, but the following lines in the third canto: “Later came minutes, hours, whole days at last, When she’d be absent from our thoughts, so fast Did life, the wooly caterpillar run.” It’s as if to say, since life for Hazel was a caterpillar, may the afterlife be a butterfly.\\n\\nTo clinch this interpretation, the reader will note that, not only does her ugliness make apt the poet’s comparison between Hazel and “the woolly caterpillar,” but her particular method of suicide, and his hopes for her survival in the afterlife, especially do too. For, the caterpillar’s self-induced metamorphosis is, in a sense, a kind of suicide; and the development it undergoes is especially redolent of drowning: Inside the chrysalis, “the chewing mouthparts of the caterpillar are transformed into the sucking mouthparts of the butterfly,” which lives on a strictly liquid diet. “When the butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, its wings are small and wet[.] The butterfly must pump fluids from its abdomen through the veins in its wings, which causes the wings to expand to their full size.” How marvelous!\\n\\nOne hopes, in writing such an expansive note, to silence those reviewers who find the poem of Pale Fire neither fiery nor poetic, but rather pale and pedestrian, poor to the point of being a disguised prank on the part of Nabokov. That this opinion can emerge from only a superficial reading is something that the outspread marginalia on this page is intended to convey. But, like an encased caterpillar dreaming of wings, I’m ahead of myself.',\n",
       "  'This childhood collapse is an augury of the poet’s death fifty years in the offing, whose truth is shown by the parallels between the two events.\\n\\n\\n“One day, when I’d just turned eleven”: The poet will be killed by an assassin’s bullet days after turning sixty-one.\\n“as I lay prone on the floor”: The fatal bullet will drop our poet prone on his neighbour’s lawn.\\n“watched a clockwork toy–a tin wheelbarrow and pushed by a tin boy–bypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed”: (“The boy was a little Negro of painted tin,” reports Shade’s commentator, having once seen the curio in the poet’s basement.) Moments before his killer’s arrival, the poet will notice his neighbour’s young black gardener pushing a barrow up a lane of shrubbery before disappearing behind a hedge.\\n“there was a sudden sunburst in my head”: The child has a sudden vision of expanding light upon the onset of his collapse, before blacking out and enjoying the out-of-body experience described in the next stanza. Of course, whether this is an augury of what the poet will experience upon his later death–that is, his final collapse–depends on confirmation that remains somewhat wanting. However, what is intended, it seems, is that, by finding confirmation of the other parallels within this string, the reader is to make an inference to this last and most momentous one. As we shall see, the death scene is itself pregnant with auguries that seem to mean this conclusion.',\n",
       "  'In the opening canto to his poignant biographical poem, John Francis Shade introduces many of the central themes on which he is to enlarge both musically and musingly in the cantos that follow.\\n\\nWe learn of his early aesthetic sensibility to the world’s enchanting details; his life-long wonder at the possibility of a life after death; his mysterious visions brought upon by momentary swoons, and the circumstances surrounding one of these swoons which seem to portend quite plainly the circumstances of his own death.\\n\\nAs we shall learn from his third Canto, Shade’s long struggle with the question of the great beyond was finally contented by the following curious belief, namely, that coincidences and parallels between events in one’s own life evince, through their aesthetic elements, the existence of artistic, godlike beings, who artfully manipulate the world for their own aesthetic appreciation.\\n\\nWe shall see mingled throughout the poem many such parallels and coincidences which seem to indicate or presage events that are of paramount importance to Shade, suggesting strongly that his view was right. “Ah, but surely,” we may chide ourselves, “these are mere fabulations, whimsical inventions the poet took the liberty to insert in order to bolster his pet metaphysical theory.” The trouble, however, is that one such coincidence — the clearest and most momentous of all — cannot be explained away so straightforwardly, because the foreshadowed event is that of the poet’s own death. Could, then, Shade have been right? Was the source of at least this coincidence an artistic, godlike being, who manipulated and played with Shade’s world for the sake of his own aesthetic appreciation?\\n\\nMy scholia are like Kinbote’s only half scholastic; but unlike his, mine are designed to illuminate another man’s life without appropriating it. It is in this vain that I have written some of the proceeding marginalia, elucidating for the poet’s reader the many beauties, those eerie coincidences and parallels, which have been either overlooked or obfuscated by his late and self-styled ‘Zemblan’ annotator. In so doing, I submit that the poet was right. Shade’s world was indeed manipulated by an artistic being from a world beyond his. For his was a world of fiction, and ours the world of the author of that fiction, who dictated its artistic elements for our own aesthetic appreciation. In other words, Shade’s god was Nabokov; and by examining the artful parallels and coincidences that he conjured into Shade’s world, we can, I believe, derive that immense aesthetic appreciation for the sake of which that world was created.',\n",
       "  'Our poet seems in the fourth canto reconciled to his fate. Having sobbed out his agony over the tragic loss of his daughter; having recalled her troubled life, its tender moments, and the ominous night of her ugly suicide; having revisited his guilt and keen despair and struggled to rationalize some form of the afterlife up which his hopes might clamber, he seems now to enjoy a respite, a tranquil temperament with which he treats the reader to some light and desultory musings.\\n\\nHe first relates his bemusement over two methods of composition. Method “A”, he tells us, consists of the penless poet caught off-guard by the murmured combinations of a garrulous muse: In the shower, on a long drive or perhaps browsing at the local mart, the poet bound by quotidian tasks is turned automaton when the unbidden words and numbers crowd him from an unknown source. Method “B”, on the other hand, is planned and deliberate: The poet here is found at his usual perch—the heavy desk, grand lectern or quiet arbour—on schedule with his allotted time and faithful utensils, actively trying to round out the stubborn line or broken stanza, calculating, forming pictures, waiting for the right term or trope to present itself as he sits staring at his daunting pages.\\n\\nIn connection to this is the everyday aesthetics that Shade moves on to highlight next. As he advances from a droll episode of somnambulation to a nick on the throat while shaving we see him yet again accentuate the beautiful details in the mundane.\\n\\nHe next expresses his calm content over the metaphysical view he’s finally adopted regarding gods—cosmic artists working on the world—and the hope it gives him of one day reuniting with his daughter: “I’m reasonably sure that we survive And that my darling somewhere is still alive, As I am reasonably sure that I Shall wake at six tomorrow on July” etcetera, etcetera. We find out from his commentator, of course, that on the morrow Shade does not wake; that, moments after penning these final lines, he is shot dead by an assassin who misidentifies him as the intended target.\\n\\nTragic as this might be, it is infinitely more artistic, and puzzling. The last stanza, which he had just completed to finish off his poem and which included a description of his immediate surroundings before his death, reveals, unknown to its author, that the circumstances of his end were presaged by the circumstances of a collapse he suffered in his boyhood, soon after his eleventh birthday. That collapse—related in the first stanza—culminated in “a sudden sunburst in my head. And then black night. That blackness was sublime. I felt distributed through space and time,” which, if one is rereading the book, suggests that, if the circumstances of this collapse mirrored the circumstances of his death, then perhaps the out-of-body experience which resulted from that collapse was mirroring the experience he would enjoy immediately after his death. As I have emphasized elsewhere, these foretelling parallels, unlike the many we have found between events involving his wife and his daughter, could not have been ad hoc fabrications that the poet inserted into his poem, because what gives significance to these parallels is his very own death, of which he could not have known prior to the fact nor written of it in the sequel. This then is a chestnut, but I think I’ve cracked it elsewhere, showing Nabokov to be that artist-god who, working on the world of Shade and acting as his muse, fashions these aesthetic parallels and writes them into his hero’s poem.\\n\\nThat some critics have deemed this work an uninspired third-rate effort is an absurd judgment which it has been the aim of these notes to overturn and laugh at.',\n",
       "  'From the third canto we learn that, years ago, when their daughter was still “a mere tot,” the poet and his wife attended meetings at the Institute of Preparation for the Hereafter (I.P.H.), a sort of quack institute whose objective was to provide insight and guidance on the afterlife, and at which Shade and other guests were invited to give lectures on the topic as it was understood from their respective areas of expertise, whether secular or spiritual.\\n\\nThis wide array of eschatological exposure proves to be influential to Shade’s life-long search for the great beyond, but only, he tells us, in so far as it informs him of all that has been amiss in humanity’s numerous conceptions of a possible afterlife. His long acute sensibility to the world’s delightful details refuses to accept as desirable any such possibility that lacks the memory of those details from one’s existence prior to death. Moreover, he seems to suggest that what is essential to our individual identities is the set of memories we accumulate from our day-to-day experiences, which, were it destroyed by death, would make impossible our self-same continuation in any form of life thereafter—going so far as to declare,\\n\\n[…] I’ll turn down eternity unless\\nThe melancholy and the tenderness\\nOf mortal life; the passion and the pain;\\nThe claret taillight of that dwindling plane\\nOff Hesperus; your gesture of dismay\\nOn running out of cigarettes; the way\\nYou smile at dogs; the trail of silver slime\\nSnails leave on flagstones; this good ink, this rhyme,\\nThis index card, this slender rubber band\\nWhich always forms, when dropped, an ampersand,\\nAre found in Heaven by the newlydead\\nStored in its strongholds through the years.\"\\n\\nThat this likens Shade’s conception of personal identity to that of the 17th-century British philosopher, John Locke, is a line of thought most likely to produce a tremendous yawn. For a proper understanding of the poem, and of the man who wrote it, it is better to focus on that which is related in the rest of the canto, beginning with the poet’s temporary death, his vision of the hereafter, his heightened obsession with the question of a possible life after death, and the eventual relaxation of this obsession by the adoption of a strange metaphysical conception of the world and the gods beyond it.\\n\\nIt is at a poetry club some months after the suicide of his daughter where John Shade, after giving a talk on ‘Why Poetry is Meaningful to Us’, collapses and experiences, while being momentarily dead, what he feels certain is a vision from the great beyond. His description of this vision is, I believe, of no minor significance, because it seems to sketch, or at least I like to imagine that it does, roughly what could be interpreted as the formation of a chrysalis as it would appear from the inside, raising yet again the possibility of a life after death somewhat similar to that which is enjoyed by a caterpillar, once it has metamorphosed into a butterfly. “[B]lood-black nothingness began to spin a system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre we to understand this as an implication by Nabokov, however well he may have slipped it by his hero, that Shade’s soul, hanging momentarily on the threshold of the afterlife, glimpsed its own reincarnation before it was revived back into its human form? The credence of the reader here is no doubt meant to strain.\\n\\nAt any rate, the experience quickens his lifelong wonder at the great beyond, and, by presenting something to which he can fasten his desperate hope of one day reuniting with his dead daughter, heightens his passionate search for answers more definitive.\\n\\nHaving seen in his vision an object that he can only describe as a white fountain, he is amazed when reading an account of a similar vision in which the same object seems to have appeared. Tracking down with all alacrity both the author of the article and the subject of this vision, however, leads to sore disappointment when it is revealed to him that an overlooked typo in the printed edition had resulted in a “fountain” where what was intended was “mountain”.\\n\\nDesperate and despairing, Shade has what might charitably be described as an epiphany about life: These visions, that article, that typo, all these things coming together to cause a bustle and a brouhaha, are just some of the countless little details and coincidences in life that betoken the intelligent, artistic manipulation of the world by a realm of gods far beyond it. Indeed, the stuff of this world, being both the canvas and the paints, the tokens and the registers in a game, the instruments in an orchestra, are manipulated and arranged by god-like beings for the sake of their own aesthetic appreciation.\\n\\n\\nYes! It sufficed that I in life could find\\nSome kind of link-and-bobolink, some kind\\nOf correlated pattern in the game,\\nPlexed artistry, and something of the same\\nPleasure in it as they who played it found.\\n\\nIt did not matter who they were. No sound,\\nNo furtive light came from their involute\\nAbode, but there they were, aloof, and mute,\\nPlaying a game of worlds, promoting pawns\\nTo ivory unicorns and ebon fauns:\\nKindling a long life here, extinguishing\\nA short one there; killing a Balkan king;\\nCausing a chunk of ice formed on a high-\\nFlying airplane to plummet from the sky\\nAnd strike a farmer dead; hiding my keys,\\nGlasses or pipe. Coordinating these\\nEvents and objects with remote events\\nAnd vanished objects. Making ornaments\\nOf accidents and possibilities.”\\n\\n\\nA sublime, uncanny, and altogether insane conception, it is this aesthetic, metaphysical picture of the world to which Shade finally fastens his hopes, and his reader can only smile when it dawns on him that, in so far as Shade was a fictional character, in so far as fiction can be said to be orchestrated by a realm of beings well beyond its own, the poet, in this instance, was right.',\n",

It is as if to say, the time is 8:15, the time is Hazel’s time, it’s Hazel’s time to go.\\n\\nThe poet, who is composing these lines well after the death of his daughter, is inventing details which, he believes, would’ve advanced his hopes: “I’m reasonably sure that we survive, and that my darling somewhere is alive.”',\n",
       "  'The narrative is set in the 1950s, when television sets were equipped with dials one would have to rotate in order to toggle through the available channels:\\n\\n\\n\\nAs her daughter is undertaking her own suicide, Sybil rotates the television dial from channel to channel in search of something for her and her husband to watch. Earlier, when she finally found something satisfactory, the dial was left on channel 8, an upright lemniscate symbolizing Hazel and infinity. Now, she turns the dial again from channel to channel — trk, trk, trk — until, disappointed, she turns off the television which causes, on the display, “a pinhead light [to] dwindle and die in black infinity.”\\n\\nThe diction used to describe the television programming is obviously alluding to death. What might not be obvious is the significance of the phrase “network roulette”. Not only does this aptly allude to the lethal game of Russian roulette, but its primary allusion is to the gambling game of roulette, and the roulette wheel:\\n\\n\\n\\nA small ball is cast into a spinning wheel containing various— but I feel so unmotivated to go on explaining the rules of such a ridiculous pastime. Go elsewhere for that, and notice how felicitous it is to compare the revolving ball to the rotating television dial when toggling through channels; or the blacks and reds of the wheel to those of Sybil’s “ruby ring”:\\n\\n\\n\\nor the ball’s trk-trk-trk when faltering against the wheel’s various slots to the trk-trk-trk of a television’s rotating dial; or the dial’s ‘U’ to the wheel’s zero (or double-zero: a lemniscate so over-pinched the volutes part asunder); or the white roulette-ball to that “pinhead light” which dwindles and dies when the television is turned off.',\n",
       "  'This sentence may as well end here for its premonitory power.\\n\\nThe night at the Shade residence began to foreshadow Hazel’s suicide when her mother, Sybil, “scrutinized her wrist”, and noted that it was 8:15. I have proposed that there is intentional significance here, since the time displays a lemniscate (the meteorological symbol for haze, and the mathematical symbol for infinity), and two numbers which sum to 23, Hazel’s age on the night of her death. It’s all as if to say: The time is 8:15; the time is Hazel’s time; it’s Hazel’s time to go.\\n\\nLater that night, the time is eleven when her mother sighs, beginning her sentence with “Well, I’m afraid”. This is dramatic irony; for not only do we know that she has much to fear, but that, at the time of her utterance, the hands of her wristwatch point to 11, and 12, again two numbers which sum to Hazel’s age: Haze, Hazel, infinity; for Hazel I’m afraid.\\n\\nShe augurs well and knows it not, and it’s not for nothing that her name is Sybil. The Sibyls were a group of women who would, much like our Sybil, present their prophecies in enigmatic fashion.\\n\\nPictured below is the Delphic Sibyl as Michelangelo limned her on the Sistine Chapel.

(Eliot was still alive in 1957, the year of the night in question.)\\n\\nAs I mention in my annotation of “Enghazay”, the words whose meanings Hazel is said to have requested occur in Eliot’s Four Quartets, and seem to forebode the circumstances of her death. Eliot, then, appearing on a television show on the night that Hazel commits suicide, is yet another ominous feature of the programming seen by the Shades, features which mirror the circumstances of their daughter’s end—or so the poet later invented when composing his poem.)',\n",

There he is bedecked in tweed and sauntering on a dais: “Apropos Eliot’s poem,” he drones, “we may well call it… engazhay.”\\n\\nIt has been pointed out — the source escapes me — that the words whose meanings Hazel requests are recondite terms from a recondite poem, namely, Four Quartets by T.S. Eliot. (How fitting, then, for Kinbote to point out that Eliot’s name in reverse is ‘toilest’, suggesting the meaning of one who toils— toils to write a puffed up poem, one might have said.)\\n\\nNot only does Shade seem to be ridiculing Eliot, but in doing so he has chosen words which put in Hazel’s mouth seem to forebode the circumstances of her suicide: “Grimpen” is used in Four Quartets to refer to a bog (borrowed from the “Grimpen Bog” in Conan Doyle’s The Hound of the Baskervilles); “Chthonic”, pronounced THON-ik, means “dwelling beneath the surface of the earth”; and “sempiternal” means “everlasting or eternal”.\\n\\nSince Hazel walked off a roadside marsh to drown herself in its adjacent lake, both Grimpen and Chthonic are significant here; but what of “sempiternal”? Are we to infer that, since the first two terms apply, the third must too, and that Hazel still exists somewhere in some supernatural, everlasting form?\\n\\nNot so fast. We must remember that the poem is composed by the girl’s father, well after her death; a deeply mournful father, weighed down by guilt, and desperately hoping for an afterlife, some form of existence which has preserved his daughter and of which he is finally convinced by adopting some absurd but comforting metaphysical picture.\\n\\n“I’m reasonably sure that we survive\\nAnd that my darling somewhere is alive.”\\n\\nThe invention of coincidences to enforce a pet theory explains the above, but it cannot explain the astonishing parallels between the circumstances of the mental collapse Shade suffered in his childhood and the circumstances of his own death after the composition of the poem.

That, while this might be what it amounts to in modern circles more often than not, the real purpose is to provoke a community of original and intelligent thought by offering up an opinion that is well written and poignant enough to inspire the creation of new thought. Like the authors that write what we critique, we should focus on what our efforts bring into the world after being expressed- always striving for the open-minded and even open-ended because that is what ends up building something worthwhile.\\n\\nI had a really great Humanities teacher.

       "  \"Things Fall Apart is my first encounter with Chinua Achebe’s work. I happened to see it up on the circulation shelf on my last trip to the library while I was checking out and remembered it was on my forever-growing TBR list. After I asked for it, the lady next to me mentioned she had studied it in school and that she ended up keeping the book because it was wonderful. After reading it, I can certainly see why it would be an interesting study. That’s usually a point towards any of my favorite books. I have a lot of affection for books that open up new channels to me in further research and reading. I also have a lot of affection for nuance and for tribal and historical novels that can capture and cultivate the art of the spoken story. I feel that Achebe quenches that affection quite satisfyingly for me.\\n\\nPointing out Achebe’s use of nuance isn’t anything new; most of the positive reviews I’ve seen for Things mention it/praise it. Just as most of the negative reviews I’ve seen for the book mention that nothing much happens in the book and/or they weren’t overly impressed by the revealed tribal culture- that there are books out there that describe it more exotically and with more aplomb. I would definitely agree on the exoticism front. I would go as far as saying that it’s this agreement that makes the book so impressive to me. It’s not about the exotic, it’s about the context of a community that isn’t based on fancy, fetish, or the centralization of some big, booming scene that seeks to drag the reader in. It puts forth complex themes (politics, religion, colonization, the pro and cons of such, the self awareness of the individual and the pull or even necessity of acting on the behalf of a whole, etc.) in a straightforward manner and, to me, it’s this that is the most moving element. Because these themes are not foreign and, in reality, the society of “the tribe” isn’t either. In this way, Achebe’s nuance honors tribal history while leaving room for interpretation of his work, his themes, and their context on a scale of both personal and modern societal planes. This is aplomb, this is assurance and intelligent writing, in my opinion. This is George Eliot, Dostoevsky, Gogol, etc. A look into a bit of society that holds current because it is a magnifier for ourselves historically and presently.\\n\\nAs quoted from Yeats' The Second Coming, “…The falcon cannot hear the falconer;/Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;/Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,” I believe it is both poignant to Achebe’s book as well as to the readers of his work that the creation of confusion, anarchy, etc. is brought on by an inability to hear that which we are moving away from. If we are merely to be moved by exoticism, we lose the introspection our past can lead to- the themes that repeat so often in generations. While Achebe’s Things will fall to positive and negative reviews as books are wont to do and I hold no real opinion on what it means if the novel is liked or not by someone- I believe that the merit of his book stands apart because it offers something vital to its readers that isn’t just based on plot line, era, character, or specific culture/society.\\n\\nQuote\\n\\nAmong the Igbo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten.\",\n",
       "  'Personal Take\\n\\nPicking up this book was an impulse guided by a quarterly reading challenge (read a steampunk novel); the genre didn’t really have a showing in my TBR pile until this challenge. After surreptitiously googling “steampunk novels” to outfit my lacking store of related knowledge, I came across really good reviews for Miéville’s Perdido and figured it was worth a shot. I didn’t have much luck with it when I began.\\n\\nI was reading quite a lot of Victorian-era books and even though I felt like it would be a natural-next once I’d read some Wells, I couldn’t slip into it. Miéville takes you into a quick dive, leaving you ashore in a completely new world. That’s definitely not a criticism, it’s wonderful. However, it took me awhile to see New Crobuzon for all it is rather than focusing on the burgeoning character plot lines and letting them map it out for me. NC is very much the main character of the novel and it can be an immense deal to take it all in.\\n\\nThat’s impressive to me. The effort on the part of the author makes this an impressive work. However, I felt the muddle of plot close in at parts and it colored the vastness of NC for me a bit. Reading a few interviews with the author, he’s said that Perdido would probably be shorter/more edited if he were to take it on again. I think that would help that vastness take on more of the intended effect.\\n\\nThis being said, I found it a more enjoyable read as I got more into it. Miéville’s prose provided an intellectual and emotional susurrus that I ended up being very intrigued by. And yes, Mr. Miéville, thank you for using words like susurrus and salubrious. Mm. They were the equivalent of a vodyanoi diving into clean, cool water for a word lover like me.

He held to the view that the Weavers were a species of conventional spider that had been subjected by some Torquic or thaumaturgic fluke – thirty, forty thousand years ago, probably in Sagrimai – to a sudden, short-lived evolutionary acceleration of explosive velocity. Within a few generations, he had explained to Rudgutter, the Weavers evolved from virtually mindless predators into aestheticians of astonishing intellectual and materio-thaumaturgic power, superintelligent alien minds who no longer used their webs to catch prey, but were attuned to them as objects of beauty disentanglable from the fabric of reality itself. Their spinnerets had become specialized extradimensional glands that Wove patterns in with the world. The world which was, for them, a web.\\n\\nOld stories told how Weavers would kill each other over aesthetic disagreements, such as whether it was prettier to destroy an army of a thousand men or to leave it be, or whether a particular dandelion should or should not be plucked. For a Weaver, to think was to think aesthetically. To act – to Weave – was to bring about more pleasing patterns.

I think one of the former reviews I’ve read on this book said it best; a lot of readers have complained that they got a lot more moths than answers and, as such, the book was very dissatisfying. However, the reviewer went on to say that there are so few answers because our “protagonist isn’t aware that there needs to be” or that there are even questions lurking about in her own familial and personal history. In that way I think the gothic theme of the story is wrapped up very nicely, especially for a debut novel, from the symbolism of the decrepit/vacant in the house and the relationships/secrets held within it.\\n\\nI found the story to be engrossing and interesting.

       "  'Kathleen Grissom’s bio on Goodreads is long, very long. But I have to quote from the first part of it because it made me excited to read something from her.\\n\\n\\nBorn Kathleen Doepker, I was privileged as a child to be raised in Annaheim, Saskatchewan, a hamlet on the plains of Canada. Although we lived in a small, tightly knit Roman Catholic community, I was fortunate to have parents who were open to other religions and cultures. Since television was not a luxury our household could afford, books were the windows that expanded my world.\\n\\nSoon after Sister Colette, my first grade teacher, introduced me to Dick, Jane, and Sally, I began to read on my own. I was a fanciful child and became so influenced by books that while I was reading Five Little Peppers And How They Grew I ate only cold boiled potatoes (the truth is this lasted only for a day) as I suffered with them through their hardships. After reading Anne Of Green Gables I was convinced that I, too, was adopted, until my mother told me to stop the foolishness and to look in the mirror. I had her nose. She was right. I limped desperately during Red Shoes For Nancy until my sister, Judy, told me to cut it out, people would think that something was wrong with me. Wanting to more closely experience Helen Keller’s tribulations, at every opportunity I walked with closed eyes until I solidly whacked my head on a doorframe. Enid Blynton’s Famous Five series had me looking for adventure around every corner, and when in class Rudyard Kipling’s, Kim, was read aloud, I couldn’t wait to leave for far-off lands.\\n\\n\\nShe also mentions her current project on her website:\\n\\nPresently, I am researching and writing about the true life story of Crow Mary, a Native woman who carried a Colt revolver on her studded belt and wasn’t afraid to use it! Can you imagine the fun I am having?\\n\\nPersonal Take\\nGrissom’s a new author who’s pretty stoked about the process and that’s infectious. I might have had a bit of criticism for The Kitchen House but I’m looking forward to checking out any future works.\\n\\nAlso, new authors should always be supported, read, and never taken for granted.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSources\\nGrissom’s website',\n",
       "  \"Personal Take\\n\\nI’m pretty iffy on plantation stories. Often they end up seeming trite and disrespectful, focused more on melodrama than on actual history. So if an author doesn’t have an actual connection to their material it’s probably going to be a bust for me. Especially if the book is historical fiction because I’m going to expect a good emphasis on the historical part of that genre.\\n\\nHowever, Grissom has a good opening: a young Irish girl winds up the indentured servant of a very screwed up household but she finds a family in those that work the kitchen and ‘big house.’ Through her eyes, and the eyes of Belle – kin to the ‘Captain’ but forced to work in the kitchen for his wife and white children – we see a lot of the prevalent issues of the age such as relationships, the massive strength of character some people can have under inhumane conditions that would break most, denial of paternity, secrecy, idiotic medical practices that killed more people than they helped, a quick peek into the despair of a mental health hospital and the ability of a husband to toss his wife in one should he choose, rape and the resulting trauma, etc. Surely there is a lot of merit behind a book (and an author) that encompasses all of this. I’m not going to say that there isn’t, no worries. What I will say is that, as a first book, I feel like more was bitten off than should have been. There are times of very frustrating shallowness in the depiction of characters that could have flown off the page larger than life given the right dose of prose and ink. Rather, the subsisting element of the book is crisis after crisis.\\n\\nThis element makes the crises run together rather than allowing her characters to grow as they face a specific thing. So the depth of the characters becomes implied rather than really explored by the author. It’s a rather tepid complaint. I kept reading and I wouldn’t say that this book wasn’t worth the read. It encompasses historical realities that should be remembered and respected. I just wanted to see more than I did of certain characters, to see them fleshed out more… I guess ‘consistently’ would be the word.\\n\\nFacts\\n- Kathleen Grissom’s first book & only English book as of yet.\\n- Published in February of 2010\\n- The story is told from two perspectives: Lavinia and Belle.\\n- Grissom states in her author’s note that the book came about while her and her husband were restoring an old plantation tavern in Virginia. She was inspired by the history of the surrounding area and by an acquaintance of her father’s who had traced his ancestry back to Irish emigrants who had a similar fate to that of her character Lavinia.

       "  'Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (1922 – 2007) was a humanist and an intellectual pacifist. He was also the American writer best known for his works entitled Cat’s Cradle (1963), Slaughterhouse-five (1969), and Breakfast of Champions (1973). His work was largely influenced by his imprisonment in Dresden as a private in the 423rd Infantry Regiment, 106th Infantry Division during the Battle of the Bulge. While imprisoned he witnessed the bombing of Dresden. This is responsible for the semi-autobiographical parts of Slaughterhouse-five.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto of Kurt Vonnegut from an appearance on WNET-TV (1972)\\n\\nIn Bagombo Snuff Box: Uncollected Short Fiction, he listed his rules for writing short stories.\\n\\n\\n\\nUse the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.\\nGive the reader at least one character he or she can root for.\\nEvery character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.\\nEvery sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.\\nStart as close to the end as possible.\\nBe a Sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.\\nWrite to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.\\nGive your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also mentioned that the greatest writers tend to break most or all of these rules.\\n\\nVonnegut was also interested in graphic art, starting with illustrations in his books and collection.

       "  'Personal Take (Deluge ahead, prepare.)\\n\\nI tried picking this book up for the first time when I was 14 and didn’t end up finishing it. I wanted to be a Vonnegut fan, I wanted to enjoy the book and find an intense illumination within it like so many others seemingly did. Said expectation and desires took the wind out of my sails though and I think I’m very glad that they did. If they hadn’t I don’t think I would have been able to appreciate it in the way I do now, upon finishing it a few minutes ago.\\n\\nFor instance, I recently read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. Another book I wasn’t at a place to finish as a teen because it flung open views within myself that I wasn’t at a place to have or examine. As a very good lit teacher I was lucky enough to have once said, “the best stories are the ones that come into your story at just the right time.” I put both The Bell Jar and Slaughterhouse-Five on the same level when it comes to a genuinely wrought plunge into depression, PTSD, and the fallible human.\\n\\nThe main complaints I’ve seen about Slaughterhouse-Five seem to concern the ultimate style of the book which is often said to be less influential and impressive these days than it was when the book was published and the over-usage of ‘so it goes.’ I’m not a Vonnegut expert and will not pretend to comment on the whole of his work. But I will say that I took the style of this book as more a glimpse into the emotional and neurological effects of PTSD rather than a stylistic enterprise. It is certainly chaotic but, viewing it this way, I did feel it added an essential element to the book. As for the repetition, I believe it was also essential… at least from the context of Vonnegut’s personal expressions. For example, I found myself remembering (time jumping to?) various experiences I’ve had with grief/loss/death as well as trauma. And, on the outside of those experiences, I don’t think anything felt more poignant than these three words.\\n\\nI’m hoping I can explain the above adequately… from my experiences, I don’t believe grief is a vacuum that can be bottled up into a specific amount of time. I believe both it and PTSD span further than that in a lifetime. That you might grieve the loss of someone because of a random memory or because you’re at a different level of maturity in your life and did not previously possess the same depths as you do in this moment. I think there isn’t really a better example of this than that of children that lose a parent at a young age or soldiers that lose their friends in the middle of a war. There isn’t a well for grief to draw from in the moment so you can easily see how it takes shape in different avenues of their lives. Such as a kid acting out, dealing with intense depression through a relatively happy event in their later lives, etc. This long-standing relationship with grief, loss, ptsd, etc. also shapes the person’s attitudes towards more personal loss or (at least) loss in an intellectual context.\\n\\nHence, ‘so it goes.’ Because for those that have crossed that line in life, that really is the way it goes. To some it may signify an ambivalence but, from my perspective across the line, I believe it is simply an accurate acknowledgement of reality and personal context. So I actually felt as if each individual repetition packed quite a wallop within itself.\\n\\nFacts\\n\\n\\nPublished in 1969 (for earthlings), it has always been and will always be published for you Tralfamadorians.\\nAlso entitled The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death.\\nWritten during a two year teaching stint at University of Iowa. Vonnegut has said that this stint is what brought him out of his ‘writing funk’ and made writing feel important again.\\nUpon hearing that his books were being banned and/or burned in high schools and towns (a practice still being enacted at certain schools), Vonnegut said:\\n\\n\\n\\n“My books are being thrown out of school libraries all over the country—because they’re supposedly obscene,“ Vonnegut told the Paris Review. \"I’ve seen letters to small-town newspapers that put Slaughterhouse-Five in the same class with Deep Throat and Hustler magazine. How could anybody masturbate to Slaughterhouse-Five?”\\n\\n\\n“In a ‘Special Message’ written for the Franklin Library’s limited edition of Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut writes, ‘The Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive and meticulously planned, was so meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it. I am that person. I wrote this book, which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation, such as it is… One way or another, I got two or three dollars for every person killed. Some business I’m in.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nFavorite Quote\\n\\nSo it goes.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSources\\nFacts/Quotes\\nMore Information',\n",

       "  \"Personal Take\\n\\nThis book started out with 3 stars from me. (Egads!) Two subsequent stars came along only after I’d sat with it for a bit (and ranted thoroughly about it). The work itself is a little like opium. The scent, the words, the depth and even the demise of it’s characters being intoxicating as, rightly, any novel with gothic elements should be.\\n\\nI think the reader can grandly sup on Wilde’s quotable and quite revealing prose. I found the inversion of Plato’s philosophy that an educated love of beauty, truth, etc. can beat out immorality to be intriguing and wonderfully wrought.\\n\\nI might have wanted to sock Lord Henry one too many times, but I respect and admire how his character and the influence of said character upon Dorian is rendered. However, as mentioned before, I found myself ranting quite a bit about the annoyance and disgust I felt towards the characters as a whole or as individuals. This is definitely not one of those books to find many a redeeming quality floating about it’s principal players. Which definitely serves its point well enough.\\n\\nAll in all, I loved the painted picture cast by Wilde’s voluptuously wordsmith prose. I loved how much I hated the characters' sybaritic lives. I loved that it made me think and even draw out my dusty Plato knowledge from a humanities class that had rolled under a few ancient stacks of odds and ends in my brain.\\n\\nFacts\\n\\n\\nThe first edition of the novel was published in 1890 in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine. Wilde later published another version with an additional six chapters (1891).\\nThe themes include mortality (and in turn the mortality of youth), the purpose of art vs. the purpose of life, art imitating life, morality, and influence.\\nBiographers have proposed the The Picture was not only based on the handsome John Gray, a poet that Wilde met in 1889, but also a courtship.\\nIn a letter written to the St. James' Gazette  Wilde wrote: “…[Dorian Gray] is a story with a moral.

The first being Maggie Rose, a girl Maggie-Now’s father is desperately courting. Being the secondary Maggie adds to the passive persona of the character.\\n- The reviews were split concerning Maggie Now and it was not as successful as A Tree by far.\\n- Some believe that the hesitation of the author because of her personal life and the length between novels made her confine her primary character to the era-appropriate definition of a “good woman.”\\n\\nA quote by Joanne Frye fleshes out this definition  of cultural expectations rather perfectly:\\n\\nwomen, if appropriately female – that is, relational, expressive, passive – will not be competent and self-defined. From this gender stereotype spring the traditional character traits and plot choices for female characters; in service of this gender stereotype women in novels are placed in the midst of domestic social reality and bounded by a novelistic coherence of erotic and familial concerns. This same stereotype also implicates women outside novels in the limitation of femininity as it yields a possible “motive to avoid success” or at least undermines their confidence “on achievement-related issues.” This stereotype even governs the possibilities for how women are perceived by others and how they perceive themselves.\",\n",

During dinner, Stephen’s dislike towards Django grows increasingly apparent due to the fact that he is a free man and is free to ride a horse alongside white men. As the senior house slave he has the luxury of being the authority over the other slaves but his intellect, like that of all slaves, is grossly underestimated by his owner. This is a kind of freedom of itself because it affords Stephen the opportunity to watch and see what is really going on at the dinner table. He becomes suspicious of Django and Broomhilda. In the kitchen, he taunts Broomhilda. Later, he informs Candie that Django and Schultz are more interested in Broomhilda than purchasing a mandingo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamuel L.

Her former masters were German. Therefore, they gave her a German name and taught her to speak the language. When she is bought by the Brittle brothers, she meets and marries Django. Together, they attempt an escape, but are found shortly after. They both receive an R-shaped burn in the cheek (R for runaway). Django witnesses Broomilda’s brutal, severe whipping and begs for them to spare her and whip him instead. Afterwards, the Brittle Brothers decided to sell Django and Broomhilda separately. As Django begins his bounty-hunting journey, Bromhilda has been bought by Scotty Harmony, the son of a slave owner. THe owners treat her kindly and accept as apart of the family. They soon come to love her and she becomes their favorite. One night, Scotty takes her out for a night on the town and they eventually end up at Calvin Candie’s Cleopatra Club. The night turns into a card game between Scotty and Candie, at which the stakes, when they run out of money, become Candie favorite slave Sheba vs. Broomhilda. After Candie produces a winning hand, Scotty calls him a cheater and Candie challenges him to a duel for besmirching his name in his own establishment. Scotty realizes his predicament: he can’t go home without Broomhilda nor can he face his parents. He can’t leave and Candie shoots him dead. After Candie kills him, he humiliates Broomhilda by whipping her in the middle of the streets while she’s naked. Awhile after he brings her to Candie Land, she attempts to run away, resulting in a harsh, brutal punishment. She was put in the hotbox, a box used to punish misbehaving slaves. Anyone placed in the hot box will experience heat, dehydration, heat exhaustion, and even death. She was supposed to stay for 10 days (and presumably die), but Django and Schultz show up, and Schultz requests to see her. Candie assumes it’s because Schultz is German and he would want to speak with someone in his native language. So Broomhilda only stays for a day and is removed form the hot box in front of Django and Schultz (in a harrassing and humiliating way). When Broomhilda is brought to Schultz’s room, Django joins them and surprises her. Broomhilda faints.

He owns the fourth largest cotton plantation in Mississipi which he calls, creepily enough, Candyland. Calvin Candie gets his wealth from forcing male slaves to fight to the death in Mandingo fights and running a brothel in Greenville in his Cleopatra Club, making him a pimp/slavemaster. Calvin shows great joy in watching Mandingo fights despite all the gore and agony displayed for all to see. Calvin even feeds a slave to dogs for refusing to fight any more of these gladiatorial battles. Calvin justifies his inhumane treatment towards blacks by using psuedo science. Blacks, he claims have dimples in their skulls in a part associated with submissiveness, hence it is only suitable that they be slaves as it is their natural state and they can take much pain. His best friend is Stephen, an Uncle Tom who caters to his every need to the detriment of his fellow slaves. Another slave close to him is Sheba, seen at the Cleopatra Club who is his mistress and also shows no disgust, fear at the Mandingo fights taking place at the club.

While tracking down the Brittle Brothers, Schultz came across the Speck Brothers and their slaves who were marching the country for days. Schultz claims he is looking for a slave who knows the Brittle Brothers and the Specks allowed the former dentist to inspect the slaves. When Schultz came to Django who was originally owned by the Brittle Brothers, the Specks refused to sell him and grew impatient with Schultz. When Ace Speck threatened Schultz to go away, Schultz kills Ace and crippled Dicky Speck by shooting his horse.

Other episodes with an explicit focus on Homer’s exposure to LGBTQ issues would include “Three Gays of the Condo” and “There’s Something about Marrying”—and there is also Homer’s relationship with his assistant Karl as played by Harvey Fierstein in the episode “Simpson & Delilah”.\\n\\nThere’s a further joke in this exchange, a particularly well-done example of the common sitcom trope of having two characters not realise that each one, during the same conversation, is talking about something completely different. Homer, convinced that Burns is coming onto him, manages, without realising or missing a beat, to turn him down with a phrase (“back-door shenanigans”) that encompasses both Homer’s interpretation and Burns’s intended meaning. It’s worth noting that Wikipedia, in its plot summary of “The Last Exit to Springfield”, highlights its quotation of “back-door shenanigans” into a sly, disguised hyperlink to its article on “sodomy”. Without any real suggestion of the phrase’s other, more usual connotation (i. e. shady dealings). Having already noted that Homer has misconstrued Burns’s vocabulary, it seems odd that Wikipedia would so bluntly and yet subtly point out the double-entendre that lies behind “backdoor”.',\n",
       "  \"Many of the Simpsons writers—notably John Swartzwelder, George Meyer, Josh Weinstein and Bill Oakely—have shown a consistent fondness for reviving “old-timey” language usages. Often these are slang terms of bygone America (from, say, the Civil War to the turn of the century); one fairly famous example is Burns’s use of a very old-fashioned way of greeting somebody on the telephone.\\n\\nBart has often been a conduit for the writers' enjoyment of this kind of language. Other examples here and here and here. (He knows his British, too.) This particular phrase makes use of quite a widespread, albeit archaic, way of referring to small amounts of money. “Gander”, meanwhile, roughly means something like a long look or a stare, presumably with reference to the long necks of a goose or a gander. The geographical origin of the word’s usage as slang doesn’t appear to be known for certain, but it is probably 19th Century British (Cheshire, specifically).\\n\\nAlthough Bart and the writers are clearly showing off their love of arcane language, the joke also turns on the common prejudice that the American South is populated by unintelligent, unsophisticated, backward people—who are still using outdated measurements of currency and who have an excessive interest in human deformity.\\n\\nBart’s phrase has quite possibly inspired the naming of a (bluegrass?) musical group.

       " 2851948: [\"Sonically, the most obvious feature of this first verse is the -ah sound which terminates each line; this persistent, almost unnatural repetition becomes the backbone of the verse, anchoring all of the rhymes which occur around it. The sound returns in the background vocals of the chorus (“hah hah hah”).\\n\\nBut this is just the beginning. The real meat of the verse are the two syllables before this sound, an aggressive trochee which, with the terminal -ah, create the multisyllabic rhymes structuring the verse. The Weeknd introduces this structure in the first two lines:\\n\\nI’m tryna put you in the worst mood, ah\\nP1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah\\n\\nRhyming “worst” with “church” and “mood” with “shoes” is slant at best, and simple assonance at worst. The ah sound saves the rhyme, creating a greater sense of likeness between the end line sounds than the isolated words actually have. “Mood” and “shoes” are also drawn together with the first line’s “you.” This -ou rhyme will be developed extensively later.\\n\\nComing in at ten and nine syllables respectively, the first two lines are longer than every other line in the verse (except the sixth line, which is nine syllables). As the lines shorten to eight syllables each, their rhyme scheme tightens and complicates. At first, it seems the third line further loosens the rhymes: “hurt you” not only sharpens the “church” into the hard end of “hurt,” but abandons the “s” at the end of “shoes” for “you.” But something else happens, too:\\n\\nMilli point two just to hurt you, ah\\nAll red Lamb' just to tease you, ah\\n\\nTogether, lines 3 and 4 are wound tight with the perfect rhymes of “two,” “to,” and “you.” In order to move away from the relative slack of the first two lines' rhyme, The Weeknd repeats “just to,” rhymes “you, ah,” and reinforces both with “two.” The result? The verse promotes the assonance of “mood,” “shoes,” and “you” to create the primary, driving multisyllabic rhyme.\\n\\nBy now, a pattern begins to emerge. The Weeknd uses paired sounds to create the satisfaction of consistency, but also as pivots to evolve one structure into another. This creates texture and variety. For example, lines 4 and 5 are pretty regular:\\n\\nAll red Lamb' just to tease you, ah\\nNone of these toys on lease too, ah\\n\\nThe last three syllables are almost perfect rhymes, and the lines are identical in length. This allows him to let out the slack in line 6, which comes in at 9 syllables with a significant change in sound: “week” and “lease” aren’t slant rhymes, rather yet another use of assonance. Despite this, the “too, yah” rhyme sufficiently continues the “too, ah” of line 5. And the change is necessary, as is obvious in comparing 6 with 7 and 8:\\n\\nMade your whole year in a week too, yah\\nMain bitch outta your league too, ah\\nSide bitch outta your league too, ah\\n\\nWhile “lease,” “week,” and “league” all have the same internal vowel sound, they do not rhyme. The Weeknd uses “week” to transition between the soft sound of “lease,” and the more guttural “league.” The slack from line 6 whips back for the taut and satisfying final lines. When sung, “out your” and “out of your” both become “outta your,” delivering two perfect seven-syllable rhymes–while also recalling lea- from “lease” in “league”.\",\n",

There are a number of religious references peppered throughout the song. Although Abel has material wealth, he yearns for spiritual wealth which is missing in his life, evidenced by the fact he prays for cars instead of love.\\nThis line exemplifies the internal struggle he’s having.\\n\\nPerhaps Abel is suggesting the house represents himself as empty and in need a centerpiece—perhaps God or some more existential peace.  Though he has all the riches and success he’s still resoundingly void and lonely. In the song’s music video, he uses a glowing red cross to destroy his musical accolades, suggesting their frivolity.

Where storms over a sea indicate facing trouble alone, in a dangerous environment, the highway tells us the subject is on a path of regret that is going at a tremendous speed, and in a location where he has neither the capacity to stop not that to considerably slow down. Dylan tells us that the storm (or trouble) is also brewing over the tendency to rush through a path of regret.\\n\\nAs for “winds of change”, it is a common saying that tells us that there is no possible way of containing the changes that are coming, just as there is no possible way to contain the wind that blows.\\n\\nWhile the start of the verse may make one think that these terms hold a negative connotation, Dylan says “you ain’t seen nothing like me yet”, as if to say his influence is worse – more powerful – than the forces previously listed.\",\n",

       "  'This sounds like such a simple love song at first, but when you really look at it there are a lot of hidden layers.\\n\\nThe first key to understanding what Dylan is trying to express is to actually take the auxiliary verbs that he uses seriously: “I COULD offer you a warm embrace”; “I COULD hold you”; “I [would] go hungry…”; “I COULD make you happy…”\\n\\nSo, the narrator (A) wants the beloved to feel his love for her (“I would”) and (B) it is within his power to make her feel his love (“I could”), BUT something is preventing Him from doing what he wants to do and is able to do.\\n\\nIf He “would” and “could” why hasn’t He? Because no matter how powerful Love is, nobody can be “made” to feel it. Love invites, it calls, it draws, but it never demands. The moment love demands to be recognized or forces itself upon another it has become something else. Something evil and self-centered.\\n\\nShe cannot feel His love because she refuses to let him embrace her until after all her doubts have been erased. Love must be received and welcomed BEFORE one knows that it is true.\\n\\nThe reality is that he is able to (and will) “make” her feel his Love, but not until after she has chosen to believe it despite a lack of proof.\\n\\nHe has chosen to promise his love (and life) to her based on nothing except her beauty and the hope that she will hear and believe his Word. Until she chooses to have FAITH in His love for her they will both suffer alone for eternity.\\n\\nAt the heart of this deceptively simple love song then, I think, is the idea that Love (whether human or divine) cannot be proven to be true until the beloved chooses to believe that it’s true without any proof. Love is fundamentally a union between two based on promise and faith rather than feelings and proof.',\n",

He doesn’t wonder what He’ll gain or lose by putting Himself out there. He simply gives Himself away on the off-chance that one of us might look back at Him and offer ourselves in return.   The recklessness of His love is seen most clearly in this – it gets Him hurt over and over. Make no mistake, our sin pains His heart.  Yet He opens up and allows us in every time. His love saw you when you hated Him – when all logic said, ‘They’ll reject me,’ He said, ‘I don’t care if it kills me.

Grantland broke it down:\\n\\n\\n The telephone rang at Warren Hinckle’s San Francisco home at about 3:30 in the morning on Wednesday, April 29, 1970. When Hinckle picked up the receiver, he heard the unmistakable voice of Hunter S. Thompson, calling from Aspen, proclaiming, “Goddammit, Scanlan’s has to cover the Derby. It’s important.”\\n\\n The pitch, even at the late hour and the late date (barely 72 hours before the race itself), was fairly irresistible. Send Thompson, still finding his distinctive voice in countercultural journalism, to his hometown of Louisville to cover the drunken, debauched scene at Churchill Downs for Scanlan’s, the anti-establishment (some would say subversive) monthly magazine for which Hinckle was co-editor.\\n\\n Hinckle agreed on the spot, booked Thompson a ticket, wired him expense money, and then set about finding an artist to provide illustrations for the story. Originally, he had hoped to send a photographer to shoot the event, but after haggling with Thompson, he instead hired the English illustrator Ralph Steadman.',\n",

That’s totally true, Steadman says.\\n\\n “He took me to the airport and was like, ‘Get the hell outta here, you goddamn scumbag. Get outta here,’ ” he says. “I just thought I’d never hear from him again.”',\n",

Rather, this is an early example of gonzo journalism, a style of writing pioneered by Thompson which, unlike the majority of journalists who strive to have at least some objectivity in their writing, brings the author into the story, almost as a character, through anecdotal (and often opinionated) first-person narrative.\\n\\nThompson developed gonzo journalism after becoming frustrated with traditional journalism and intended for it to be a style of writing that would speak truth-to-power. As he wrote in a 1959 letter:\\n\\nI have given up on American journalism. The decline of the American press has long been obvious, and my time is too valuable to waste in an effort to supply the “man in the street” with his daily quota of clichés, gossip, and erotic tripe. There is another concept of journalism, which you may or may not be familiar with. It’s engraved on a bronze plaque on the southeast corner of the Times Tower in New York City.\\n\\nThe plaque at the New York Times he refers to carries Joseph Pultizer’s 1883 mission statement:\\n\\nAn institution that should always fight for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, always fight demagogues of all parties, never belong to any party, always oppose privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty.',\n",

The powerless, on the other hand, never experience opportunity – it is always arriving at the later time.\\n\\nThe nettlesome task of Negros today is to discover how to organize our strength into compelling power so that government cannot elude our demands.

It would be the height of naivete to wait passively until the administration had somehow been infused with such blessings of good will that it implored us for our programs.\\n\\nWe must frankly acknowledge that in past years our creativity and imagination were not employed in learning how to develop power.  We found a method in nonviolent protest that worked, and we employed it enthusiastically.  We did not have leisure to probe for a deeper understanding of its laws and lines of development.  Although our actions were bold and crowned with success, they were substantially improvised and spontaneous.  They attained the goals set for them but carried the blemishes of our inexperience.\\n\\nThis is where the civil rights movement stands today.

His struggles are described in a more detailed fashion in some of his other tracks; namely Deadbeat Girl, Total Zombie and Gone. Jackson is “burnt out” after another failed romance.\\n\\nThe repeating of “again” throughout the song enforces Jackson’s cyclical structuring of this song; it’s all about how the narrative is one that he knows will repeat itself.'],\n",

In a 2012 article arguing that All’s Well was cowritten with Thomas Middleton, Oxford scholars Emma Smith and Laurie Maguire write:\\n\\nIn 2001 MacDonald Jackson explored the unusual name of the character Spurio.[6] Spurio is named twice (TLN 643 and 2267) although he does not appear in the play. The name occurs only once elsewhere in Renaissance drama, in Middleton’s Revenger’s Tragedy (Q 1607) where it makes symbolically appropriate sense as the name of the Duke’s bastard (spurious) son. This led Jackson to conclude that the name originated with Middleton and was picked up by Shakespeare.  There may even be an intertextual joke: although Spurio is a character in Revenger’s Tragedy, he is never named in the dialogue (his name occurs only in stage directions); Shakespeare’s Spurio, on the other hand, is named in the dialogue but is not a character in the play.   This ludic inversion indicates Shakespeare’s familiarity with a written text of Revenger’s Tragedy, either in manuscript form (the play was written for the King’s Men at a time when Shakespeare and Middleton were collaborating on Timon of Athens, probably in early 1606) or in its first printed edition of 1607/08.'],\n",

Industrial Schools were established to take in orphaned or abandoned boys or those who were involved in petty crime, and even such a minor offence as skipping school could be enough for a boy to be sent there. It has been said that about 5% of the children in Artane, indeed in all Industrial Schools, were actually orphans. Most of the incarcerated children were from families that had broken down and as separation was not allowed either, the children of these broken marriages were incarcerated and the religious institution in whose charge the children were put were paid one-third of a labourer’s wage to feed, educate and clothe each child.\\nWikipedia',\n",

We can conclude, then, that if what has been displayed in the scene is not exaggerated, but is intended as an accurate portrayal of contemporary Irish culture, then it is not, in fact, overacting.',\n",

Joyce here alludes to Oscar Wilde’s The Sphinx, and Don Gifford points us to the Sphinx’s being address as “exquisite grotesque! half woman and half animal.” The poem’s speaker rejects her as the creature of a  “songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of the night… Get hence, you loathsome mystery! Hideous animal, get hence!” he commands. “You wake in me each bestial sense, you make me what I would not be.”',\n",
       "  'This references back to the Scylla and Charybdis episode wherein Stephen is discussing Hamlet, “the distracted” or absentminded beggar. The allusion is to a Hamlet soliloquy in which he asks whether his own inaction is caused by “bestial oblivion,” or by a dull or cowardly thoughtlessness. Since both thought and action in this episode are bestial, “dull” and “cowardly” perhaps are better indictments of Stephen in the previous episode. Hamlet’s tendency to forget his purposes as avenger of his father’s murder, is similar to Stephen’s propensity toward distraction as to his purposes as literary creator, as demonstrated this evening through mind-numbing alcohol and sex, something paralyzing many young Irishmen, but is especially unfortunate with one, who, like Hamlet, has a supposedly unique role to play, requiring action, not degenerate inaction.\\n\\nMuch of Joyce’s great talent is due to a nearly encyclopedic memory and ability to focus, to avoid distraction. Something that becomes very apparent to the Ulysses reader is how critically needful those gifts are for himself.',\n",
       "  'The character “Bello”, vile and indecent himself has just carried out a barrage of indecencies to humiliate Bloom. Joyce then has “him”, with fortified irony, rail against Bloom with “Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you;” it is Bloom being consigned to the lowest point of Hell – it is he being condemned for immorality by the vilest of wretches. The scene’s counterpoint in The Odyssey is in Book 10 wherein Odysseus begs Circe to let him leave to continue his journey home. She gives him the bad news that, before he can return home he must visit the Land of the Dead – Hell. When Odysseus points out to her that no one has ever visited there and returned, she gives him directions for the trip and tells him of the sacrifices he must make for a successful journey. In fact, Joyce has already placed Bloom at Hell’s depths. Are there to be hints as to how he might find a safe return?',\n",

       "  'Matthew Arnold was an Oxford don who argued for a renewed religious faith and an adoption of classical aesthetics and morals, particularly representative of mainstream Victorian intellectual concerns. A main theme Joyce borrows from his has to do with the effects of Hebraism and Hellenism. He writes: “At the bottom of both the Greek and the Hebrew notion is the desire, native in man, for reason and the will of God, the feeling after the universal order, — in a word, the love of God. But, while Hebraism seizes upon certain plain, capital intimations of the universal order, and rivets itself, one may say, with unequalled grandeur of earnestness and intensity on the study and observance of them, the bent of Hellenism is to follow, with flexible activity, the whole play of the universal order, to be apprehensive of missing any part of it, of sacrificing one part to another, to slip away from resting in this or that intimation of it, however capital.” The term “Hebraism” is used generally to infer the benefits and moral constraints of religion, while “Hellenism” refers to the “perfecting” effects of high culture. This is a significant and involved theme for Joyce, and to determine his intentions for its use is subject to discussion. Clearly drunkenness is not something Arnold would condone.',\n",
       "  'Should read, “Who’s moth moth? Who’s dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is Gerald.” This points to the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno who had an impact on Joyce. Bruno wrote extensively on the art of memory, a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles, and we see them mentioned in Virag Lipoti’s “testimony” at Bloom’s “trial” three times. But, much more importantly, are the hidden references to Bruno’s doctrine of the coincidence of contraries, by which he means: “Every power in nature or in spirit must evolve an opposite as the sole condition and means of its manifestation; and every opposite is, therefore, a tendency to reunion.” Joyce mentions this in an examination essay he took in Padua in which he adds that Bruno taught that these “contraries” create a power “without which man cannot fulfill himself.” So we see these opposites appearing in minor things such as the inverting of Virag’s name. Giordano Bruno was burned to death for his “heretical” views on February 17, 1600',\n",

This is the “Flower” that “Bloometh.” Now, as defendant in his “trial,” he appears, “holding a fullblown waterlily,” symbol of purity of heart. In the opera, Don Caesar has been tricked into marrying Maritana, and is unhappy, not knowing who she was, veiled as she had been for the ceremony. Maritana is now gone from his life, and he sings, “There is a flower that bloometh / When autumn leaves are shed. /… Oh, pluck it ere it wither, / ‘Tis the memory of the past// It wafted perfume o'er us, / Of sweet, though sad regret / For the true friends gone before us, / Whom none would e’re forget. / Let no heart brave its power, / By guilty thoughts o'ercast, / For then, a poison flow'r / Is – the memory of the past.”\\n\\nIf Bloom ever had true friends, there are none there to defend him.

       "  'This whole episode is a wild and weird Witches Sabbath, and its phantasmagorical method makes it difficult to maneuver. The initial scene has us guessing at what it is we’re looking at when the narrator describes a cart owned by the “real” Antoni Rabaiotti dispensing ice cream, surrounded by squabbling “stunted” men and women, who greedily “grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow.” They’re all “children,” the narrator explains. The immediately available choices for interpretation are, of course, many and diverse: Are the figures children who are “stunted” future adults? Are they merely callow adults acting immaturely? A deeper search by the reader will reveal that this first scene hearkens back to the Wandering Rocks episode, where children are eating ice cream by Rabaiotti’s ice cream cart when they encounter a one-legged sailor who “growls” at them. That he is a sailor is why the children order him to salute.\\n\\nOf course, nothing has to make sense in this surreal setting, but, since Joyce is not one to “waste” his imagery, a carnival atmosphere such as this at the gateway to the carnal, when the root of “carnival” is carne vale, or “farewell to flesh,” with vale representing a Latin “good-bye” (literally “be strong” or “be well”), it is difficult not to see this as yet one more jab at Irish lechery-born paralysis, especially when, after clamoring for the ice cream, and having sucked on what turns out to be lumps of coal and copper snow, the children “scatter slowly” in apparent chagrin.\\n\\nWhat we will encounter repeatedly in Circe are glimpses into past passages in the book that now take on completely different understandings – epiphanies.

The theme of waiting for love, subordinate to the greater theme in Ulysses of The Pain of Love, is brought center stage here in Circe’s stage-play setting when we recall the Siren episode’s narrator saying, “Time makes the tune.” It certainly makes the tune heard in THE CALLS\\' whistle here in Circe.

The name St. Vitus Dance derives from the late Middle Ages, when persons with the disease attended the chapels of St. Vitus, who was believed to have curative powers….Most often a manifestation of rheumatic fever, Sydenham chorea occurs most frequently between the ages of 5 and 15 years, and is more common in girls than boys. The disease may occur as an infrequent complication of pregnancy.\\n\\nSt. Vitus' dance is also the term for a medieval dancing mania, a bizarre social phenomenon in which:\\n\\n…outbreaks seized groups of people who engaged in frenzied dancing that lasted intermittently for days or weeks. Social scientists typify victims as females who were maladjusted, deviant, irrational, or mentally disturbed. These activities were typically accompanied by symptoms similar to tarantism, including screaming, hallucinations, convulsive movements, chest pains, hyperventilation, crude sexual gestures and outright intercourse. Instead of spider bites as the cause, participants usually claimed that they were possessed by demons who had induced an uncontrollable urge to dance.\\n\\nThe causes are still not fully understood; however the Skeptical Inquirer argues that religious sects (not disease or “hysteria”) were probably responsible, and that many “facts” about the dancing manias (that they were spontaneous, mostly sustained by women, etc.) don’t hold up to scrutiny.\\n\\nMedieval dance crazes: truly crazy.\",\n",

In a pleasant village, at the foot of New York’s Catskill Mountains, lives kindly Rip Van Winkle, a Dutch villager. Van Winkle enjoys solitary activities in the wilderness, but he is also loved by all in town—especially the children to whom he tells stories and gives toys. However, he tends to shirk hard work, to his nagging wife’s dismay, which has caused his home and farm to fall into disarray.\\n\\nOne autumn day, to escape his wife’s nagging, Van Winkle wanders up the mountains with his dog, Wolf. Hearing his name called out, Rip sees a man wearing antiquated Dutch clothing; he is carrying a keg up the mountain and requires help. Together, they proceed to a hollow in which Rip discovers the source of thunderous noises: a group of ornately dressed, silent, bearded men who are playing nine-pins. Rip does not ask who they are or how they know his name. Instead, he begins to drink some of their moonshine and soon falls asleep.\\n\\nHe awakes to discover shocking changes. His musket is rotting and rusty, his beard is a foot long, and his dog is nowhere to be found. Van Winkle returns to his village where he recognizes no one. He discovers that his wife has died and that his close friends have fallen in a war or moved away. He gets into trouble when he proclaims himself a loyal subject of King George III, not aware that the American Revolution has taken place. King George’s portrait in the inn has been replaced with one of George Washington. Rip Van Winkle is also disturbed to find another man called Rip Van Winkle. It is his son, now grown up.\\n\\nRip Van Winkle learns that the men he met in the mountains are rumored to be the ghosts of Hendrick (Henry) Hudson’s crew, which had vanished long ago. Rip learns he has been away from the village for at least twenty years. However, an old resident recognizes him and Rip’s grown daughter takes him in. He resumes his usual idleness, and his strange tale is solemnly taken to heart by the Dutch settlers. Other henpecked men wish they could have shared in Rip’s good luck and had the luxury of sleeping through the hardships of the American Revolution.',\n",

He leaves his wife Annie and three children to go to sea with his old captain, who offers him work after he had lost his job due to an accident; in a manner that reflects the hero’s masculine view of personal toil and hardship to support his family, Enoch Arden left his family to better serve them as a husband and father. However during his voyage, Enoch Arden is shipwrecked on a desert island with two companions; both eventually die, leaving Arden alone there. This part of the story is reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe. Enoch Arden remains lost and missing for more than ten years.\\n\\nHe finds upon his return from the sea that, after his long absence, his wife, who believed him dead, is married happily to another man, his childhood friend Philip (Annie has known both men since her childhood, thus the rivalry), and has a child by him. Enoch’s life remains unfulfilled, with one of his children now dead, and his wife and remaining children now being cared for by his onetime rival.\\n\\nEnoch never reveals to his wife and children that he is really alive, as he loves her too much to spoil her new happiness.

       "  'Gifford suggests “Stephen’s witticism implies that Mr. Deasy’s letter is addressed to a chosen people in a promised land,” which would certainly be consistent with the references to “mouth” and “foot”, considering the letter’s subject having to do with Foot and Mouth Disease. However, if one considers the text in Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews (there is only one) there are other possibilities. Stephen could be reacting to Bloom’s preaching at him as saying what is written in verse five, “And again, I will be to him [Stephen] a Father, and he shall be to me a Son.” Verse nine contains words that Bloom might suggest apply to Stephen and his talents: “God, hath anointed thee… above thy fellows.” As for opening one’s mouth and putting one’s foot therein, in this context, it could be an indication of Stephen’s doubts over either assertion.',\n",
       "  'This could refer to the case involving King Edward VII, who, before his coronation, was Duke of Cornwall and Prince of Wales, and who was called on to testify on the witness stand in divorce case. It was Edward who, among other royals and nobles, seems to have started the tattoo fad during his time. It is probably more likely, however, that, given the reference to the #16, a furtive reference to homosexuality, and also, considering the verbiage to appear shortly in the paragraph about something “under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature… except women chiefly, who were always fiddling more or less at one another… to acts of impropriety between the two…,” that this is probably attributable to a case in 1883 in which two officials in Dublin Castle, named Cornwall and French, were publically involved in an extensive homosexual circle.',\n",

       "  'There is a temptation to perhaps make more of these two sentences than Joyce intended. The immediate assumption is that Joyce is simply having Bloom state that Italian “impetuosity” is in the blood, and that “All are washed in the blood of the sun” is a pun on the Christian doctrine of redemption through the blood of the Son of God, or “blood of the Lamb” as the term is used in Lestrygonians. All three of the men are intensely emotional and romantic, in one form or another, Aquinas mostly in the chivalric sense. But it can be said that in each of the three flowed blood fired by religious conviction having been washed in the blood of the Son of God. Joyce often used Christian symbology and ritual as metaphor, and some argue that, regardless of his rejection of the Catholic Church per se, and his violation of Christian practice, in his more mature years, he realized that his faith was an inherent part of his identity, just as Bloom’s Jewishness was part of his, even while outwardly rejecting the tenets of Judaism. In this section in which the nature of souls, and their possible simplicity and the reconciliation between reason and belief is mentioned, it is highly unlikely that a reference to Aquinas is coincidental, despite the ironic word following “blood of the sun.”',\n",
       "  '“Thomas the Mastiff,” or rather Saint Thomas Aquinas, on whose philosophy and theology Dante based his Divine Comedy. Joyce creates another isosceles triangle among the three great Italians, to whose “impetuosity” Joyce points here. If “isosceles”, who among the three in this triangle would he suggest is the hypotenuse as a representation of singular greatness? Perhaps Dante, despite his reliance on Aquinas.',\n",

       "  'Latin for: “not at all ignorant of misfortune, I have learned to succor the miserable.” This would be better uttered by Bloom.

       "  'The linking of Ibsen with the “stonecutters” leads Don Gifford to speculate that the allusion here is to Ibsen’s play When We Dead Awaken, appropriate for the state in which both men, but especially Bloom, find themselves, having been roused. The description of the sculptor’s wife’s feeling on being awakened in Ibsen’s play is appropriate at least for Bloom after his “awakening” to his true sense of himself as a Jewish man in Dublin after his experience in Circe: “Her airy freshness is as a breath of keen air. The sense of free, almost flamboyant, life, which is her chief note, counterbalances with the austerity of Irene and the dullness of Rubek.”',\n",

Joyce might also have gotten it from Charles Dickens' David Copperfield (London, 1849-50) where, in Chapter 60, Copperfield thinks about his first wife: “With the unerring instinct of her noble heart, she touched the chords of my memory so softly and harmoniously, that not one jarred within me; I could listen to the sorrowful, distant music, and desire to shrink from nothing it awoke.

Moreover, she hears in this scene a music of love that he can never hear, or, as the text says, “strained his ear to listen” to.

Gabriel is considered to be a comfort to man, whereas his counterpart, Michael (whose namesake appears at the end of the story) is the church militant; the name Michael in Hebrew translates “who is like God.” The Archangel Gabriel announces the coming of John the Baptist to Zacharias ( Luke 1:11-20 ) and of the birth of the Christ child to the Virgin Mary ( Luke 1:26-38 ).\\n\\nJoyce takes Gabriel’s name from a novel by the nineteenth-century American writer, Bret Harte (1836-1902): Gabriel Conroy. This has been a puzzle for Joyceans, since the character as well as the sometimes sentimental and always adventurous aspects of the novel seem to have no connection to Joyce’s story (other than a descriptive paragraph quoted below); the title character of Harte’s novel is a robust outdoorsman, a California Sierra’s gold miner who becomes rich and who is embroiled in all manner of complications with women. In one of the episodes he pretends to be guilty of a crime he thinks his wife committed (she didn’t) in order to save her.

As far as the eye could reach – fifty miles, looking southward from the highest white peak – filling ravines and gulches, and dropping from the walls of canyons in white shroud-like drifts, fashioning the dividing ridge into the likeness of a monstrous grave, hiding the bases of giant pines, and completely covering young trees and larches, rimming with porcelain the bowl-like edges of still, cold lakes, and undulating in motionless white billows to the edge of the distant horizon. Snow lying everywhere over the California Sierras on the 15th day of March 1848, and still falling.\\nIt had been snowing for ten days: snowing in finely granulated powder, in damp spongy flakes, in thin, feathery plumes, snowing from a leaden sky steadily, snowing fiercely, shaken out of purple-black clouds in white flocculent masses, or dropping in long level lines, like white lances from the tumbled and broken heavens.

So why does Joyce break Aunt Kate’s thought at, “You wear them over your…?”…the hesitation suggests that the conversation is straying into uncomfortable territory, or, perhaps that the parties are discussing more than footwear.\\n\\nThis reading becomes plausible when one considers that the foot has long been a well-known euphemism for male genitals.

Later it is her past in Connacht, and a previous lover, that bring their tensions to a climax.\\n\\nIt also seems as if Gabriel is trying to disassociate Gretta from her family’s Irish heritage by answering Miss Ivor: “Her people are [of Connacht]” instead of simply saying something to the extent of, “yes, she is”.\\n\\nThis is reminiscent of a scene in The Great Gatsby where Daisy covertly conveys to Gatsby that she loves him by saying: “‘You always look so cool’…‘You resemble the advertisement of the man..’”\\n\\nIn both instances, Gabriel and Daisy try to convey their love for Gretta and Gatsby, respectively, by equating them with the realms that they themselves exist in or identify with. Daisy raises Gatsby to her realm of a high-society capitalistic nature, while Gabriel relates Gretta to his ideal of the continent.',\n",

Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education.― “The Dead” by James Joyce\",\n",

In fact, Joyce (perhaps, here, as self-reference) takes the title of this very story from a poem in the collection:\\n\\n\\nOh, ye Dead! oh, ye Dead! whom we know by the light you give\\nFrom your cold gleaming eyes, though you move like men who live.\\nWhy leave you thus your graves,\\nIn far off fields and waves,\\nWhere the worm and the sea-bird only know your bed,\\nTo haunt this spot where all\\nThose eyes that wept your fall,\\nAnd the hearts that wail’d you, like your own, lie dead?\\n\\nIt is true, it is true, we are shadows cold and wan;\\nAnd the fair and the brave whom we lov’d on earth are gone,\\nBut still thus even in death\\nSo sweet the living breath\\nOf the fields and the flow'rs in our youth we wander’d o'er\\nThat ere, condemn’d, we go\\nTo freeze mid Hecla’s* snow,\\nWe would taste it awhile, and think we live once more!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Moore and Shakespeare would have been well-known “classics” for most at the party (Shakespeare’s works being written to dynamically move a mixed audience), Browning was a more recent poet, “most famous for his short poems and his dramatic monologues, especially My Last Duchess and Porphyria’s Lover, which reveal the speakers’ true, hidden personalities from their words alone, even as they attempt to justify themselves and influence how readers see them. His works were known for their difficulty because of their cryptic themes. The lines that Gabriel plans to use in his speech are subject to a fair amount of scholarly debate; see, for example, Thomas Jackson Rice’s essay “Dante…Browning. Gabriel..Joyce: Allusion and Structure in ‘The Dead.’” [Joseph Nugent. “Digital Dubliners.” J.Nugent, 2014. iBooks.] Gabriel thinks only he would be up enough on culture to know and appreciate the British poet.\\n\\nLater it is revealed that Gabriel wrote a review of a Browning collection for a pro-British newspaper, so his original choice of the English poet further characterizes him as lacking Irish nationalism.\",\n",

The snow becomes part of his outfit, “like a cap” and “like toecaps.” By the end of the passage, the cold air seems to emanate from him, a metaphor for his own paralysis.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn architecture, a “frieze” is a section of sculpted wall. Joyce’s writing is like a sculpture here in the sense that he has captured a moment in time in great detail. But the sculptural metaphor, like that of the snow/cold also describes Gabriel’s character, unmoving emotionally and intellectually.',\n",
       "  'The orderliness without interruption that characterizes the lifestyle of the Morkans has larger thematic significance. The protagonist, Gabriel, is also characterized by a similar rigidity and intolerance for any challenge to his ideas.

The image works to emphasize an important theme: a dead boy, Michael Furey, has emotional power over Gabriel’s wife, and he himself, though living, seems to be powerless.',\n",

Gave her that song Winds that blow from the south.\\n\\nAccording to Gray’s Notes:\\n\\nOffstage throughout, [D'Arcy is] a tenor whose singing later on leads to the significant events at the conclusion of the story.

       "  'This is one to pull out whenever someone tells you off for using “literally” with a metaphor. Joyce did it. Joyce was one of the greatest novelists ever. Case closed.\\n\\n–OK, so he’s also getting away with it through a technique called “free indirect style,” which is where third person narration stretches to incorporate the thoughts, feelings, and idiomatic speech of first person. (It’s the difference between a. “Bob walked outside. ‘Damn, it’s cold,’ he thought.” and b. “Bob walked outside. Damn, it was cold.” The second example is free indirect style.) The critic James Wood notes that in this opening sentence, the language\\n\\nseems to float away from the novelist and take on the properties of the character, who now seems to “own” the words. The writer is free to inflect the reported thought, to bend it around the character’s own words.\\n\\nJoyce chooses this name literal for the flower’s association with: 1. death (it is frequently experienced – seen and smelled – at funerals); 2. the Archangel Gabriel (it is symbolic of this Guardian of the Gates of Death); and 3.

The third is a allusion to both Monet’s painting style and painting.

But they were still young men: George was 26 years old, Paul was 27, John was 28, and Ringo was 29. The Beatles' first album, Please Please Me, had come out almost exactly six and a half years earlier. So if Abbey Road had been released today, Please Please Me would date to March 2003.

Ali Shaheed Muhammad as a bassist brings in tasty, underlying grooves throughout the album, bringing him into a new context. I would say this is a notable album even if it wasn’t being widely discussed.',\n",
       "  '“King to a God”  by Joey Bada$$ is an example of the rapper returning to his hard-hitting bars. The instrumental alternates from smooth and chill to dark and grimy, keeping the listener’s attention and excitement. The track also introduced a new hungry member to the PRO ERA crew, Dessy Hinds. In any case, Joey Bada$$ deserves to be in this list considering the scope of his singles, whether freestyling over XXX’s track, reworking Prince’s “When Doves Cry”, or working with Chuck Strangers, another up-and-coming rapper.',\n",

Although thoughts and feelings about an album are entirely subjective, I thought it would be important to mention that Anthony Fantano reviewed the album and, to my surprise, gave it a score of 7/10.

After the earthquake, people were singing songs of praise in the street. It’s a strange idea that we can teach these people something. The music in Haiti is all tied up in voodoo and African rhythm and so there’s this funny thing: go to a voodoo ceremony and then go to a Catholic church and tell me which music you liked better, to which one the music is more integral.\\n\\nThe missionaries are mistaken in their belief that they can teach the Haitians about God. The Haitians know much more about God, and they express it through their music. This is what the “here comes the night time” line means- Haiti is about to come alive with religious music.',\n",

Surprisingly, it works.\\n\\nThe rhyming at the end of the first and last lines; ‘park’ and ‘dark’ repeats the first stanza and gives the poem cohesion. It comes full circle.

Not only do people not want to see him, but they don’t want to hear him either — no doubt because what he would have to say would stir their guilt.\\n\\nThomas is skilful at subverting the reader’s expectations. The choppy, uneven rhythm reinforces this; the iambic tetrameter beat of the previous line is in contrast to the bare four syllables that follow. These devices are used deliberately to reflect the hunchback’s damaged, unformed life.',\n",

       "  'The bell has several associations. It signifies the time when, we assume, the Hunchback is turned out of the park. However, a bell’s chime or toll is a metaphor for passing of time, and here it may even be death. John Donne wrote No Man is an Island ‘send not to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.’\\nIn other words, the death of any person is linked to our own death. Shakespeare’s Falstaff says in Henry IV Part 2 ‘We have heard the chimes at midnight’, signifying that death is near at hand.\\n\\nDoes this mean the Hunchback is close to death? Although he is physically just about alive, he seems to be merely existing, entirely lacking spiritual sustenance, any life-giving love.\\n\\nThere is no regular rhyme scheme, although the first and last lines of the stanza rhyme; ‘park’ and ‘dark’. This is replicated in the final stanza, possibly to signify the unending cycle of misery of the Hunchback’s life.',\n",
       "  'To identify the Hunchback as ‘mister’ suggests that his name is unknown and, worse, no one has troubled to find out who he is.  He lives in isolation.\\n\\nThe reader is told that he is ‘solitary,’ but not how or why he reached this state.',\n",
       "  \"The hunchback is humiliated even further by being described as the ‘old dog sleeper’. Yet the stanza moves the reader into a strange imaginary world. The solitary ‘Mister’ lives in a  fantasy and, maybe hallucinates to escape. The implication is that he suffers from a psychotic condition, as well as physical disability.\\n\\nThe characters in the fantasy are an illogical mix. Are the ‘nurses’ kind women from the hunchback’s past? Perhaps he was hospitalised when a child and the memory remains. Are there really swans on the lake or are they beautiful imaginary creatures that soothe the hunchback? Are the ‘tigers that jump out’ of the boys' eyes  noble wild animals, or have the boys morphed into cruel predators? Are the rockery stones the  habitat of these creatures. The alliterative and onomatopoeic ‘r’s in 'roar’ and ‘rockery’ make these fantasies all the more real in the mind of the Hunchback. The sailors echo the poet’s childhood toy ship, but why are they in the park? These questions are unanswered.\",\n",
       "  'This is a paradox. The dog kennel is shocking and beyond demeaning; the hunchback is now synonymous with an animal. Being likened to a dog suggests dog-like dependence, utterly devoid of dignity. That he isn’t chained up, we can assume, is because he has no-where else to go, so he will remain in the park anyway.\\n\\nBut, beyond that, he is imprisoned by the bleakness of his life. The word ‘nobody’ suggests utter indifference, as if the adult world can’t even trouble itself to be cruel to him. The last two lines of the stanza are spare and terse and minimal, all the words (apart from one) are monosyllables, reflecting the bareness of the hunchback’s existence.',\n",
       "  '‘Propped between trees and water’ is open to interpretation. He seems to belong to the open air and the park with its trees and lake. However, ‘propped’ suggests that the place isn’t a home of his choosing, though it is at least somewhere to exist, somewhere that can just about sustain his terrible, skimpy life. It could also imply that he needs ‘propping’ because of physical and mental frailty; he has to be literally and figuratively supported by his surroundings.\\n\\nThe lines in this and the other stanzas run on, a device called enjambment. The verse is free as if obeying its own rules. This, perhaps, reflects the unstructured life of the Hunchback.',\n",

Instead of Dershowitz (et al.) addressing some of these points, the typical counter-argument is that there’s an anti-Semitic bias in academia (under the questionable logic that being pro Palestinian renders one anti-Israel, which renders one anti-Semitic; I know).\\n\\nAt the time of this debate in November 2005, the anxiety about supposed academic anti-Semitism reached considerable heights, namely at Columbia University. A longtime vanguard of Arab intellectualism since the late scholar Edward Said, Columbia drew much scrutiny for the Palestinian sympathies of its leading Arab scholars, which spawned the controversial website Campus Watch to start listing  “dossiers” of professors with supposedly “anti-Israel sentiments”.\\n\\nHowever, after much controversy that the publicly listed dossiers were akin to a hysterical McCarthyist witch-hunt, they were taken down.',\n",

       " 'Bandar mention #2\\n\\nhttps://genius.com/8267625',\n",
       " 'The Israeli disengagement from Gaza (and the forced removal of Israeli settlers) was not exactly the altruistic compromise that Dershowitz is portraying it as. As Chemi Shalev wrote in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,\\n\\nContinued occupation of Gaza was ultimately untenable; it was a strategic nightmare, a moral morass, a bigger catastrophe waiting to happen. Israel would have found itself withdrawing from Gaza sooner or later, and no one can say whether it would have done so under better conditions than those that prevailed a decade ago, just as no one can assert that the price of staying would not have been 10 times higher than the cost of withdrawing',\n",
       " 'Below is the “fence” of which Dershowitz speaks:',\n",
       " 'Logically, this is an absurd argument.',\n",
       " 'Prince Bandar, aka “Bandar Bush” knows a thing or two about crimes “against the entire region.”\\n\\nPerhaps Dershowitz was unaware at the time, 10 years ago (11/29/05), that he was hinging Palestinian culpability for the breakdown of the 2000 Camp David Summit on the testimony of a corrupt Saudi bureaucrat who’s been the most crucial backer of ISIS, i.e. Bandar’s “private army”.']"

       "{334267: 'Notice the subtle but significant changes from the 1st Verse to the 2nd Verse. Winwood is isolating himself, signifying his friend hiding his addiction from himself. Winwood is attempting to let his friend know he is there for him. He also quantifies “long” signifying the lapse of time of the addiction and how he still can’t find his way home. This emphasizes lost hope and contrasts with the hope of salvation in “somebody holds the key.” He can see the end of his addiction (near the end) but he doesn’t have the time to kick his addiction. So he is wasted (not the alcohol wasted, but his life is wasted because of this addiction) and struggles to get back on track from addiction (can’t find my way home).',\n",
       " 161567: 'What this lyric is saying is that the subject is insignificant. In a sea which is endless, a single drop of water taken from the sea would be negligible. This could possibly imply a nihilistic view on the subject. According to songwriter Livgren, this is a paraphrasing of Ecclesiastes:\\n\\nI reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth, and I concluded:\\nEverything he has accomplished is futile — like chasing the wind! See the short sonnet “Ozymandias” written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1818.  It’s theme – the inevitable decline of all great leaders and the great empires they build. If one reads it literally, this statement is incorrect. Many studies have shown that the more affluent one is, the more likely he/she to live longer.\\n\\nStill, the difference is insignificant in the larger picture,\\nand it (life) is still a spec of fleeting dust in the wind. Most find this line depressing, whether the writer meant material things, or abstracts – like love and hope – and it’s hard to blame them.\\n\\nHowever, the one who sees the half full glass would see the negative things – feelings, periods in life, illnesses –  not lasting either.\\n\\nThe writer suggests to “not hang on” to dreams, ideals, virtues, etc, for everything is but “dust in the wind” and holding on to something with insistence may lead to madness.\\n\\nSomething similar is exposed in Ludovico Ariosto’s “Orlando Furioso” in which the protagonist, Orlando, too committed to assure himself Angelica’s love (hanging on his love for Angelica), goes crazy and literally loses his mind when he finds out Angelica has fallen in love with Medoro. Dreams may contain a whole story, but in reality most last a few seconds to minutes, the “moment” mentioned earlier.\\n\\nThe events occurring in the dreams are not within the dreamers control – a metaphor for the life which is like ‘dust in the wind’ – an insignificant and beyond our control as part of a much bigger picture. The lyricist describes a fleeting moment, literally a short dream , and this symbolizes his belief that his life also takes a fleeting, insignificant moment in history. In a 1992 interview, Kerry Livgren described what inspired him to write the song:\\n\\nI was reading a book on American Indian poetry one day, and I came across that line – this American Indian said “for all we are is dust in the wind.” Another signature instrumental part – with a violin, viola and guitars. The song signature two acoustic guitar opening.\\n\\nThe song writer’s (Kerry Livgren) wife said that it was a guitar fingerpicking exercise that she liked and convinced her husband to write a song for it. As an expression – Dust in the Wind can mean – dead, gone, forgotten, unimportant, having a fleeting time on earth, or somebody’s memmory.\\n\\nBased on the biblical (Genesis 3:19) –\\n\\n“…for dust you are and to dust you will return.”',\n",
       " 181074: 'Possibly the most poignant portion of this haunting song is the guitar solo, with guitarists Allen Collins and Gary Rossington ripping through a screaming 30 seconds or so seemingly reflecting on how hard it is to actually be a simple man in times of family, work and all of life’s obstacles, a wonderful swerve from this slow, thought-provoking masterpiece. Simple doesn’t mean stupid, it means uncomplicated. Way too many people over analyze situations, look at the things which are right under your nose – maybe a flower, a rose perhaps. What kind is it? How long has it been in bloom, and question after question – Stop! Just smell the damn thing and enjoy what the good LORD has made.\\n\\nJust take pleasure in the things that most of us take for granted.\\n\\nRelationships for instance … unless you nurture your partner and promote love in your relationship it will never fully mature, and the flower-bud which showed so much promise and potential will surely die.\\n\\nSimple things we can do as a “Simple Man.” In this line, the mother is saying no matter how much money her son does or does not make, how successful he is or isn’t, or what things he does or does not have, she’ll be proud of him if he is satisfied with the life he has chosen for himself. If you are a down to earth kind of guy, work for what you want, and do everything without cheating, you will get what you deserve When all else fails, don’t forget about God. Prayer will help you get through the hard times.\\n\\nBut you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.“\\n– Psalm 86:15 The advice given here is to not waste your life trying to become wealthy. The only riches needed are in your character. Here his mother tells him not to worry about the future and live in the moment. As if you don’t, you never live. Life moves fast and if you don’t take it slow and enjoy every minute of it you’ll miss it. This entire song is about a conversation Ronnie Van Zant had with his mother when he was young. (He was not an only son, as erroneously stated in the song. However, he could have had this conversation with his mother before the birth of his brothers.)\\n\\nWritten in about an hour, the band started telling stories about Ronnie Van Zant’s grandmother and Gary Rossington’s mother, who had recently died. During the session, Rossington came up with a chord progression, and Van Zant wrote the lyrics based on advice the women had given them over the years. It’s important to know and yourself and love what you end up being. One should never grow to resent the man in the mirror. Shades of the last verse. His mother is telling him to simply follow his heart and do what he loves, and not let anyone tell him otherwise.\\n\\nShe emphasizes the importance of passion over wealth. Instead of working for the sake of working, she wants her son to work for the sake of doing what he loves.',\n",
       " 82381: \"This is perhaps a reference to Julian Lennon’s mother Cynthia, who would often tell him to “stay strong” and “hold it together.” Paul is effectively telling him to heed his mother’s advice and keep his head up through his parents' divorce. He has found someone who he loves and is telling his son to go out and become so close to her that its like she is in your heart. He believes that this type of intimacy is important like the relationship that he had with his second wife Yoko Ono. However Julian is a child with John Lennon’s first wife where the relationship wasn’t as strong.\\n\\nHowever, this song is sung from Paul’s perspective, not John’s. This annotation makes it seem like it’s from John’s perspective but it isn’t quite. One of the most remarkable performances of the song took place at the White House, on June 2, 2010, and the last (the “na na na na na”) part is second to none!\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RFcd7PqYVU Paul was a consummate Pop Lyricist and repeated lyrics are a staple of that type music. He’s basically saying “Hey man, the situation sucks yea, but you have the power to make it bad or good. Don’t choose the former.” He’s telling Julian not to wallow in his hurt, and instead make the best of the situation he’s in by deciding to The simplicity of this refrain makes it particularly popular at large stadiums, where the crowd can be relied upon to remember all of the lyrics.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVPZXEdyuTg If you listen very carefully you can hear John swear…!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzBaI50Oc8 Bottling up emotions or trying to do things entirely on your own is a very difficult thing. The repercussions  can be very harmful to your health, mind, and spirit. Jude should avoid all that.\\n\\nAround this time, Ringo Starr’s drum parts begin. He nearly missed it because he went to the bathroom around the time that they began recording. He quickly ran into the drum booth, and began his drum part perfectly.\\n\\nThere is an amusing story about recording it. We were at Trident Studios in Soho, and Ringo walked out to go to the toilet and I hadn’t noticed. The toilet was only a few yards from his drum booth, but he’d gone past my back and I still thought he was in his drum booth. I started what was the actual take, and ‘Hey Jude’ goes on for hours before the drums come in and while I was doing it I suddenly felt Ringo tiptoeing past my back rather quickly, trying to get to his drums. And just as he got to his drums, boom boom boom, his timing was absolutely impeccable.\\n- Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now by Barry Miles. As a child you tend to shut out people who aren’t your mom and dad and set up a giant wall around yourself. The moment you open up to someone…\\n\\nThis comment seems to be directed more towards John, who had flirted with the idea of leaving Cynthia for Yoko a while before finally deciding to follow his heart. Jude possibly doesn’t like asking for advice – they tend to “carry the world on their shoulders” or take whatever’s going on in their life on their own without any help. This isn’t a reference to Yoko Ono’s appearance, but more to the fear of not liking this new woman. In the next verse, it goes on to explain that all Julian has to do is be himself and it will work out naturally. Sadly, Julian’s relationship with his father never recovered after John’s divorce. Speaking after his murder, Julian said:\\n\\nI’ve never really wanted to know the truth about how dad was with me. There was some very negative stuff talked about me … like when he said I’d come out of a whiskey bottle on a Saturday night. Stuff like that. You think, where’s the love in that? Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit … more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad. Julian, John Lennon’s first son by first wife Cynthia, was feeling somewhat put out after his parents' divorce. Despite having a Beatle for a dad, Lennon wasn’t a great father to him, instead throwing all his love into Yoko Ono (and after that, Julian’s half-brother Sean). Julian didn’t even see John until 1970, and was left out of his will completely.\\n\\nPaul was the one usually there to act as something of a jolly uncle to console the child, something John noted and was jealous of.\\n\\nThough “Hey Jude” was written to Julian Lennon, Paul wanted the lyrics to sound a bit ambiguous, so as they could affect other people as well. In a way, “letting her into his heart” could refer to Julian giving Yoko a shot. There’s a faint cursing in the background at this point in the song; a very quiet “fucking hell” can be heard if the volume is turned up. There were several stories about the source of the exclamation, but the most accepted version was that John Lennon hit an off note and swore while recording. He wanted it left on, and thus, an infamous Beatles Easter Egg was born.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzBaI50Oc8 A possible self-reference to McCartney and the sentiment of his 1967 song “Fool On The Hill”.\\n\\nThe song was written to Julian Lennon after his mother and father (John & Cyn) were divorced. Paul had a good connection with the kid. But John was convinced, to the day he died, that it was written to him. I guess John had a point… and Paul’s saying (again) to John: don’t play it cool, be nice, open up your heart, believe in love and so on… John Lennon thought that these lines were directed at him:\\n\\n“But I always heard it as a song to me. If you think about it… Yoko’s just come into the picture. He’s saying, ‘Hey, Jude – hey, John.’ I know I’m sounding like one of those fans who reads things into it, but you can hear it as a song to me.\\nThe words ‘go out and get her’ – subconsciously he was saying, Go ahead, leave me. On a conscious level, he didn’t want me to go ahead. The angel in him was saying, ‘Bless you.’ The devil in him didn’t like it at all because he didn’t want to lose his partner.”\\n- John Lennon, 1980\\nAll We Are Saying, David Sheff I was in the music room upstairs when John and Yoko came to visit and they were right behind me over my right shoulder, standing up, listening to it as I played it to them, and when I got to the line, ‘The movement you need is on your shoulder,’ I looked over my shoulder and I said, ‘I’ll change that, it’s a bit crummy. I was just blocking it out,’ and John said, ‘You won’t, you know. That’s the best line in it!’ -Paul McCartney (Beatles Anthology) “Jude” is referring to John Lennon’s son, Julian. Paul McCartney wrote the song to help comfort him when Lennon divorced his wife (Julian’s mother) to be with Yoko Ono. The song was originally sung “Hey Jules”, in reference to Julian, but McCartney thought Jude sounded better and was easier to sing.\\n\\nWhen the song was released, the music press claimed it was aimed at Bob Dylan. Hearing that, Lennon facetiously claimed: “It’s me!” to which McCartney answered: “No, it’s me!”\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are Paul’s handwritten lyrics\",\n",
       " 1575: 'square up The chorus of the song Let it be resonates with many people, as it instills feelings of hope in everyone who hears it, George Harrison played two different versions of this solo: the first version was recorded in early 1969 for the single version of this song, while the solo for the final album version was recorded in January 1970. PROPOSED SUGGESTION:\\n\\nThis was written during the infamous/acrimonious “Get Back” sessions when the Beatles were breaking apart, and Paul was trying (and hoping) to keep things together.  Hence “There is still a chance that they will see…” The original recordings, as featured in the eponymous Let It Be movie and later Anthology, had a third variation: “There will be no sorrow, let it be”. George Harrison had similar advice when it seemed things were gray. Though influenced more by Eastern religion than was Paul, in “All Things Must Pass”, he sang\\n\\nAll things must pass, All things must pass away I’m not sure if she used the words ‘Let it be,’ but that was the gist of her advice\\n\\n-Paul McCartney (Paul McCartney) wakes up to inspiration/happiness/peace, his mother has come and told him to Let it Be, to relax and all will work itself out For though, loves ones who have past away maybe gone…\\n\\nIt could be about being dead, though it seems that the song is primarily about the Beatles splitting up.\\n\\nThey are parting from each other and from their fans.,\\nStill there is a chance that the fans will see that it’s for the best.\\n\\nPaul often started some of his songs with a specific idea in mind, wrote about it somewhat ambiguously to make it a little more open to interpretation or applicable to others situations. When people around the world have similar feelings, they should just “let it be” by letting their problems take care of themselves.\\n\\nOr, this line could be meant for others who feel sad and heartbroken from a lost one, hence how this song mentions Paul’s mother who passed away. When Paul’s intuition is cloudy, his mother (Mary), who passed away, helps guide her son – illuminates his path if you will.\\n\\nThe “night is cloudy” bit could also be referring to the internal tension and conflict developing within the band at the time of recording. Such unpleasant times could be described as a “cloudy night” as a pseudonym for dark times. When Paul’s down and out, he just pictures his momma telling him to relax. After she passed Paul didn’t know what to do and he had a dream (hence hour of darkness, while he’s sleeping) and his mom came to him and told him to let it be. Mother Mary is not the Virgin Mary (although Paul was obviously aware that most listeners would take it that way), but Paul’s actual mother who died when he was young.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaul said he wrote this after a dream he had where his mother came to him and said, “let it be.”',\n",
       " 1061: 'Many years later “down the road” December 2012 – in a grand tribute to Led Zeppelin at the 35th Annual Kennedy Center Honors – rock group Heart performed an epic version with a full choir, and to top it off, with Jason Bonham, the late drummer John Bonham’s son on drums.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4izMuXBP6OA\\n\\nIt evoked a very emotional reaction from the surviving members in attendance, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and singer/songwriter Robert Plant. This minute-long guitar solo, performed by Jimmy Page, is one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous solos, and commonly regarded as one of the greatest of all time, including by  Guitar World. Live performances often extended this solo for a few minutes more, with some performances getting a six minute slot.\\n\\nAs documented by Wikipedia, sound engineer Andy Johns said in 2007:\\n\\nI remember Jimmy had a little bit of trouble with the solo on “Stairway to Heaven”… [H]e hadn’t completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he’s standing there next to me and he’d done quite a few passes and it wasn’t going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said “You’re making me paranoid!” And he said, “No, you’re making me paranoid!” It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out. The last two lines deliver the song’s punchline:\\n\\nWe are all one together. Help each other find truth. Get as many people as you can to see the beauty in the better angels of our nature.\\n\\nWe have to be steadfast (rock) and not waver (roll). ‘Rock and not roll’ is a pun on ‘rock and roll’. The intro is very similar to a section of an instrumental song, “Taurus,” by the rock band Spirit. Led Zeppelin was the opening act for Spirit on their first US tour, where the song was a regular part of their set. There was even a copyright case saying that Led Zeppelin had copied the track, but Led Zeppelin won the case.\\n\\nThe guitar introduction here has been oft-parodied, but there’s a reason it has remained classic.  It provides a superb example of the musical concept of contrary motion, where voices move in opposite directions. In this case, the lowest voice on the guitar goes down from A to G sharp to G, while the upper voice ascends from A to B to C – after that, the pattern is broken.  The orange arrows mark the lower voice, and the red arrows mark the upper one: The words “head humming, and it won’t go,” are usually used in conjunction with a song that gets stuck in one’s head.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the next line, it’s because, the “Piper’s tune” is enchanted and magical. It affixes itself into the cortex, like a parasite.\\n\\nSome may interpret it as Tinnitus, which is being subject to constant sounds coming from inside your head. This final line alludes to how after the accomplishment of enlightenment and transformation, that heaven’s price is the path of the heart, paid for by suffering for this obsession, being a worthy human being, exploring and gaining knowledge and wisdom, and earning your way, which is the only way to pay for this reward. In Greek mythology, King Midas was granted the ability to turn anything he touches into gold. He later hugged and killed his daughter, exposing his “gift” as a veiled curse.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the song, Robert Plant introduces an overly-optimistic woman, painting her in a negative light. However, here he describes an angel doing the same thing, revealing that the woman’s hope and purity are angelic traits, and she may be able to reach heaven. This suggests that there may be another way to God, or an interpretation of salvation, that she is not even considering.\\n\\nIt forewarns to keep an open-mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt also gives a message of hope. No matter where you’re at in life, even in a fallen state, as long as we’re breathing, we can return to righteousness, to get on the right path. It’s never too late. Describing an angel going along with the theme of “Stairway To Heaven” seeing as angels are often thought to be women and from heaven. To be specific, The May Queen referenced earlier traditionally wears all white and represents an idea of God more aligned with the narrator’s – of purity and truth not corrupted by greed or ego that may have motivated religions. As the May Queen also represents holiday personification, this suggests the myths of the bible may be interpreted as metaphors, and not to be taken literally.\\n\\n\\n\\nTennyson’s May Queen writes “He thought I was a ghost, mother, for I was all in white”.\\n\\nThis is also supported by the sharp change in musical tone/rhythm/style – Heart’s performance introduces a baptist choir here. When this was written, the advent of the “New Age Movement” gained traction.\\n\\nThis was the backdrop for much of the hippie culture and the alternative religions that have sprung from this fertile ground. “Age Of Aquarius”\\n\\nThis line could have been easily picked up from the bible:\\n\\nA new day will dawn on us from above because our God is loving and merciful\\n Luke 1:78\\n\\nThis seems to be a statement about how the righteous will see the kingdom of heaven. Some of the imagery might have been borrowed from Bob Dylan, who in the last verse of Mr. Tambourine Man sung about “disappearing through the smoke rings of [his] mind … far past the … haunted, frightened trees”. Many people think this describes a psychedelic experience.\\n\\nThere is a similar line in Wordsworth’s poem, “Tintern Abbey,” which goes:\\n\\nwreaths of smoke, sent up, in silence, from among the trees!\\n\\nIn ancient times, this would be a horrible sign for a kingdom, as it would represent the camps of a massive army coming to invade, and the foreboding statements of everyone else who sees the plumes of smoke.\\n\\nHowever, he could be referencing any number of things from pagan ceremonies in the woods, to old Klu Klux Klan meetings.\\n\\nHowever, knowing Zeppelin’s fondness of Tolkien references, the smoke rings may be a reference to the character Gandalf, who was often known to produce smoke rings with his pipe. A stairway to heaven is simply a metaphor, a way for us to reach heaven from our earthly abode.\\n\\nThe same idea has a well known biblical precept: the “stairway” could be a reference to Jacob’s Ladder, where Jacob has a dream of angels climbing up a ladder and ascending to heaven.\\n\\nGenesis 28:12: And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s no coincidence that she’s “buying” the stairway; this is a statement on materialism and thinking you can buy your way to salvation (which was an actual practice at one time, called “Indulgence”) or happiness. Heaven, in this case, could be a metaphor for ultimate happiness. She’s purchasing everything she wants, having it all. On her way to owning everything, material she could be approaching a material Heaven.\\n\\nBut, as with a lot of great songs, the stairway could just be a very broad metaphor used to create speculation; i.e. it could mean anything you want it to mean. “What it is, it’s the beginning of Spring, it’s when the birds make their nests, when hope and the New Year begins. And it’s nothing to do with any of that weird stuff you read about in America!” – Robert Plant.\\n\\nMeaning if the bushes are rustling, don’t worry, it’s the new wind of spring (aka “the May queen”).\\n\\n\\n\\n(Sometimes you should be very alarmed!)\\n\\nIn England, a hedgerow (a row of hedges or bushes) will often divide two properties from each other. This line is a proverb, saying that if something surprises you at your borders, or where you were counting on a boundary (maybe in ideology, beliefs, or expectations), don’t let it startle you. Comparing two ephemeral substances, shadow and soul, strengthens their imagery. The Shadow Archetype was created by Carl Jung, it represents a deep-seated negative aspect of our personality.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore intriguingly, as the sun sets, our shadows get longer. The setting of the sun is a metaphor for the end of a day or a life.\\n\\nThe sun going down elongates the illusion of our “height” and stature, in the end, our souls are measured by the light generated outwardly from within, by the development of our own character, not exterior light shining on us, which only gives a one-dimensional outline of a shape on the ground.\\n\\nThe shadows could also be our cynicism and doubt, which overshadows the beautiful parts of our personalities and souls. We believe that the bad deeds we’ve done in life are overpowering the good deeds we’ve done. The piper in this story could be like the snake in the story of creation, where the serpent pressures Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, the piper in this case could be external pressures to do something immoral.\\n\\n\\n\\nFaith/God may come in a different form than what the lady is allowing herself to hear. The path that she is following may be the mislead one, as that of the Pied Piper and of the serpent in Eden. The music of Led Zeppelin was traditionally seen as incongruous with godliness; this song in itself manifests precisely its message that God comes in forms society may not be quick to recognize.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur spiritual journey is personal, and each person’s path is unique. Ultimately, it draws us to discern the meaning, relative to our lives, in transformation and revelation. [It] was some cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. The first line begins with that cynical sweep of the hand … and it softened up after that.\\n- Robert Plant, in Total Guitar magazine, December 1998\\n\\nThis was alluded to by J. R. R. Tolkien, in “The Lord Of The Rings” in this poem:\\n\\nAll that is gold does not glitter,\\nNot all those who wander are lost;\\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken,\\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken,\\nThe crownless again shall be king.\\n\\nZep took a lot from Tolkien, using his works as inspiration for their 1969 song “Ramble On”, so it’s fair to assume he was the direct inspiration for this line. This is a clever remix of (1) the proverb “he who pays the piper calls the tune” and (2) the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\\n\\n\\nProverb: If you pay the piper, you call the tune.\\n\\nLegend: If we don’t pay the piper, he will lead our children away like rats.\\n\\nLed Zeppelin: If we call the tune, the piper will lead us to reason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe message is that money doesn’t matter: If we all just agree on the vision (tune), we’ll be led to good things.\\n\\nThere might be a religious connotation. Revelation 7:10 states that the end of the world will come, when the “great multitudes” of earth sing:\\n\\nSalvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb\\n\\nAfter Earth’s children have sung their mighty chorus, God, much like the “Pied Piper of Hamelin,” will gather his children: to follow him to their deaths where they shall meet the kingdom of heaven. While it is a little unclear at whether this line is just a shot at women who read into things too much, a potential explanation is that it relates to the condemnation of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nIn 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the Castle Church’s door which condemned the Catholic Church’s sale of indulgences.\\n\\nThe differences in Biblical interpretations prompted the Protestant Reformation. The Lady still tries to “buy her way to heaven” through good deeds as an extra precaution to achieve salvation. Since the sun sets in the West, the narrator may be trying to describe the feelings he gets when he thinks about death. This man’s soul is looking to the West, longingly, hoping to leave this earth.\\n\\nAlso, given Led Zeppelin’s fondness of Lord of the Rings references, it may likely be an allusion to the idea of “The West,” the Undying Lands, of Middle Earth presented in Tolkien’s mythology. In general the Elves go there to live out eternity in peace with friends and family, a thinly veiled concept of heaven.',\n",
       " 60905: 'Otis Redding, while touring with his band members, began to weary from all the traveling they had done. When seeing three large letters   “LSD” in the windows of his band practice room, he decided they would stay there. He wrote this song on a houseboat which they rented behind the Marin County heliport (where the windows were) in Sausalito.\\n\\nhttp://www.marinscope.com/sausalito_marin_scope/opinion/sausalito-historical-society-sittin-at-which-dock-of-the-bay/article_9ae6cf2a-3f5f-57bb-b57e-0709d4e4b994.html The problems he had back home are the same as  the ones he has now.\\n\\nThe feelings here are right in line with this verse from Jackson Brownes\\' “Your Bright Baby Blues”:\\n\\nWell, I’ve been up and down this highway\\nFar as my eyes can see\\nNo matter how fast I run\\nI can never seem to get away from me\" It’s here in the song, he reveals his true mood as he realizes it’s not all as good as he thought it would be. All his troubles and obligations (and as it turns out, all his aspirations) are gone away. All he does now is watch the tide roll in and out. At first glance, this line seems to reference the death of Redding’s bandmates.  It’s more likely it’s a phrase used to cement the emotion in the song: he’s moved across the country to a new environment and to start a new life, but he himself hasn’t changed.\\n\\nRedding recorded this song on 6 December 1967. It hit No. 1 on the pop and R&B charts the following year, but Redding and his band mates died in a plane crash  in Wisconsin on 10 December 1967. Otis was staying at a boathouse (in Sausalito, across the bay from San Francisco), which is where he got the idea of the ship coming in. Ending up in the ‘Frisco Bay was not a goal for Redding. Rather than show California as this warm sunny place; Redding reveals this place does not mean much to him. When the song was first recorded, producers worried that the sound would be too pop for Redding. They made plans to have a gospel act sing in the background of the song, but that never ended up happening. Guitarist Steve Cropper said in a interview in 1990 about Redding that: “Otis was one of those kind of guys who had 100 ideas. Anytime he came in to record, he always had 10 or 15 different intros or titles, or whatever. He had been at San Francisco playing The Fillmore, and he was staying at a boathouse, which is where he got the idea of the ship coming in. That’s about all he had: \"I watch the ships come in and I watch them roll away again.” I took that and finished the lyrics. If you listen to the songs I wrote with Otis, most of the lyrics are about him. He didn’t usually write about himself, but I did.\"\\n\\nCropper wrote most of the song himself, going off an idea that Redding had. At the time Otis conceptualized the song he was living in San Francisco. Born in Dawson, GA and raised in Macon, Ga, he grew up with the music of Sam Cooke and Little Richard.\\n\\nMore generally, “(Sittin\\' On) the Dock of the Bay” was written in 1967, and thus acknowledges the shift of gravity in American music to the west coast with the incipient hippie movement. Otis Redding was well-known for preferring to improvise the end of his songs. When Otis recorded this at Stax Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, he and Cropper didn’t have a last verse written yet; so he whistled the ending.\\n\\nHe planned to return to Memphis and fill in the verse after performing in Madison, Wisconsin, which is where he was traveling to before he died in a plane crash on December 10, 1967.\\n\\nWhen Cropper produced the song, he left the whistling in, as it fit the song’s vibe quite well.\\n\\nSIDE NOTE: Most people accredit sideman Sam “Bluzman” Taylor for the whistling. Steve Cropper debunked this myth by stating that released studio outtakes confirm that it was, in fact, Otis who did the whistling.\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VPywcHWluc#t=151 FUN FACT: These are the only lines Otis wrote for this song; his session band’s guitarist Steve Cropper finished the rest of the lyrics.\\n\\nThe song’s two co-writers exchanged ideas while playing the song. Cropper reflected on a conversation he had with Redding:\\n\\n\\nI was at the studio when Otis Redding called me from the Memphis airport.\\n\\nUsually when Otis came to town, he waited until he checked into the Holiday Inn before calling me to work with him on songs in his room. This time he couldn’t wait. He said, “Crop, I’ve got a hit. I’m coming right over.”\\n\\nWhen Otis walked in, he said, “Crop, get your gut-tar.” I always kept a Gibson B-29 around. He grabbed it, tuned it to an open E-chord, which made the guitar easier to play slide. Then Otis played and sang [this] verse he had written.\\n\\nI said, “Otis, hold on. If a ship rolls, it will take on water and sink.” He said, “That’s what I want, Crop.” So we let it go and worked on the rest of the song. The distance from Georgia to San Francisco is approximately 2,000 miles away',\n",
       " 2236: 'In the Paul McCartney biography, Many Years From Now (by Barry Miles), McCartney was said to have finalized the lyrics during a trip to Portugal in May 1965:\\n\\nI remember mulling over the tune ‘Yesterday’, and suddenly getting these little one-word openings to the verse. I started to develop the idea … da-da da, yes-ter-day, sud-den-ly, fun-il-ly, mer-il-ly and Yes-ter-day, that’s good. All my troubles seemed so far away.\\nIt’s easy to rhyme those a’s: say, nay, today, away, play, stay, there’s a lot of rhymes and those fall in quite easily, so I gradually pieced it together from that journey. Sud-den-ly, and ‘b’ again, another easy rhyme: e, me, tree, flea, we, and I had the basis of it. John Lennon would spoof this verse following the Beatles break-up (he and Paul would snark at each other during the low points of that decade…).\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev_qjPPIXZg In a biography about Paul McCartney, it was theorized that this song was actually an homage to his late mother, Mary–rather than a lost girlfriend or spouse; which is almost a little more depressing.\\n\\nPaul wrote the song while he was still in a committed relationship with Jane Asher in 1964, though this partnership would dissolve 4 years later, in 1968. Although there are many idioms related to shadows, the notion of a shadow hanging over someone seems to be a McCartney original.\\n\\nIt sits between being under a shadow, and having a shadow cast over you. Describing the shadow as “hanging” makes it seem more ominous due to the association with execution. It also implies a certain active persistence that the more passive “cast” does not. Despite the song’s poignancy, Lennon criticised “Yesterday” for not properly building to a conclusion:\\n\\nAlthough the lyrics don’t resolve into any sense, they’re good lines. They certainly work, you know what I mean? They’re good– but if you read the whole song, it doesn’t say anything; you don’t know what happened. She left and he wishes it were yesterday– that much you get– but it doesn’t really resolve. So, mine didn’t used to either. I have had so much accolade for ‘Yesterday.’ That’s Paul’s song, and Paul’s baby. Well done. Beautiful– and I never wished I’d written it.\\n\\nBoth Lennon and McCartney saw their songwriting develop significantly in ‘65, and Rubber Soul contains multiple songs that “conclude” – notably “Drive My Car” and “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)”. The melody came to McCartney much quicker than lyrical inspiration. In order to arrange the song, he quickly scribbled out placeholder lyrics. Thus, “Yesterday” originally had the working title “Scrambled Eggs”, and opened with:\\n\\nScrambled eggs\\nOh my baby, how I love your legs\\n\\nMcCartney later performed a song-length version with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots. This song, composed entirely by Paul McCartney, came to him literally in a dream. He awoke one night whilst staying in a London attic for the filming of the Help! movie with the entire melody and structure stuck in his head.\\n\\nI got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot, but because I’d dreamed it, I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written anything like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing!\\n\\nMcCartney would subsequently write “Yellow Submarine” in bed, and John Lennon would also stumble upon “Nowhere Man” and “Across The Universe” in dreams. McCartney would later observe:\\n\\nWhen you’re trying to write a song, there are certain times when you get the essence, it’s all there. It’s like an egg being laid – not a crack or a flaw in it.',\n",
       " 2965841: 'In this line, Thundercat could be using the “pretty lights,” a double entendre to represent two different ideas:\\n\\n\\nThe beautiful lights that can be seen emanating off of a buildings, or lights that can be found throughout the a nightclub. These are typically lights that “open up the night,” and set the scene for drinking and partying. This would represent “falling down the rabbit hole.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lights represent the red and blue lights that were shining off of a police cruiser after Thundercat was pulled over for a DUI. This would directly reference the track, DUI, which is the final song on the album, which has a striking similarity to the intro track, “Rabbit Ho” and represents the outcomes of falling down that same rabbit hole at the beginning of the album.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause of Thundercat’s extreme level of intoxication from a night on out, this leads to him getting pulled over for driving under the influence. Thundercat is unable to differentiate between these two kinds of lights and the lines between the beginning of the night and the end of the night begin to blur, much as both the intro and outro track blur together and are strikingly similar. Although titled “Drunk,” the album begins with a sobering cliche.  “When it rains, it pours” takes a pessimistic stance, implying that when bad weather rolls in, it comes in heavy doses.\\n\\nThis interesting juxtaposition between the title and a sobering tone continues into the second line, where Bruner introduces the feeling of isolation with “closed doors.”  which are often associated with lost opportunities.  “Open windows” imply that one can see what might be happening, but because doors are normally associated with movement in and out, the fact that they are closed, in one of their two possible states, might point to a lack of control.\\n\\nThese pessimistic feelings are an appropriate segue into the rest of the album because of the discussion of drugs and substance abuse later on in the album.  Many times, in the case of an abusive drug user, use of drugs may be predicated by feelings of isolation, lack of control over one’s life, and overall negative feelings. Going “down the rabbit hole” is a metaphor for entering into the strange or unknown. It originated in Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland – the very first chapter of that book is title ‘Down The Rabbit Hole.’\\n\\nIn the context of this lyric, the phrase also takes on a slang meaning of getting disoriented through drunkenness. Thundercat’s comparing the rest of the album to the bizarre experiences of losing sense of reality through drug use.',\n",
       " 2965842: 'By stating he feels weird Thundercat is referring to an unrest with the monotony of his life. Throughout the song he seems to be going in circles. He probably feels weird because there should be more to life than his routine. “Jesus, take the wheel” is an expression of exasperation. Forgetting one’s wallet can certainly be exasperating.\\n\\nThe expression has been used more since the song by Carrie Underwood became a huge hit. But in this verse, “Jesus, take the wheel” may be his conscience’s way of telling him not to get behind the wheel himself while drunk.',\n",
       " 2843622: 'These lines play off a proverb often credited to Abraham Lincoln:\\n\\nBetter to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt\\n\\nBy constant communication and “tweet[ing] our thoughts,” we remove a lot of the joy or interest of wondering what other people are thinking about. More often than not, following someone’s constantly updated twitter thoughts would show many of those little thoughts to be completely mundane, which can actually cheapen human interaction with that same person. Perhaps we’ve forgotten the value of occasionally being quiet and disconnected from excess information. Something changes in the world, a trend in lifestyle, technology, even Vines and Instagram hashtags, so quickly that if you leave your phone alone for a few hours, that moment could pass and you could be behind. Thundercat instead offers the alternative of disconnecting from the rat race, for one’s sanity.\\n\\n“Doing the most” is a phrase used by most millennial’s describing someone on the internet doing something dangerous or downright stupid for attention. An example of this would be the daredevils taking selfies on the antennas of skyscrapers or people lighting themselves on fire during the “Fire Challenge” phase in early 2016.\\n\\nIn “Captain Stupido”, Thundercat mentions leaving his wallet at the club. It’s possible he left his phone there too. I mean, how else would we know about our friends going to Starbucks, complain about work,  divulge our eating habits, post streams of consciousness or be social justice keyboard warriors?\\n\\nThundercat envisages life without these technologies – society and individuals survived without them in the past. Once upon a time, people used to catch up on what happened the night before through newspapers, or maybe the morning news. In the present, it’s very likely that we grab our phones and surf through Twitter, or some sort of news app, to inform ourselves. Of course, with the volume of tragedies and disasters that happen on a daily basis, the news can be often more doom and gloom, but it’s vital to keep oneself informed  to remain current with the world’s events and trends.',\n",
       " 2965846: 'This line adds to the song’s theme of cats. Thundercat wants elevate himself from being a domesticated cat to a wild big cat. Having a thunderous roar would match his moniker. His name is taken from the classic cartoon, Thundercats. It is said of cats that they have nine lives. This is probably because of their ability to get out of otherwise life-threatening situations unscathed.\\n\\nThundercat is saying that having what seems to be a freedom from consequence would be a wonderful feeling – the ability to do whatever you want and know that, at least this time, you’ll be fine. Evidently a reference to the 1970 animated film The Aristocats. A reference to a quote from character Mufasa in The Lion King (1994):\\n\\nLook, Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.',\n",
       " 2965823: 'Some people cleverly take advantage of vodka’s similar transparency to water and store it in a water bottle, giving the appearance of mere water.\\n\\n\\n\\nDrinking water during the consumption of alcohol actually helps dilute the effects of the vodka and keeps you hydrated. Thundercat wants the listener to keep in mind that this is what a real friend would do for you. “Love Lies” is the name of a song from Michael McDonald’s 1981 album If That’s What It Takes.',\n",
       " 2965852: 'Thundercat is frustrated because the girl that he is with is walking away and leaving him to drink alone, most likely at some sort of bar or club. This may be due to Thudercat’s extreme level of intoxication that took place earlier in the album. Thundercat is stating that at the end of the day, nobody, including himself, wants to be left alone to drink on a night out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThundercat uses the chorus to create this atmosphere of loneliness and regret that is brought on by his drunken-actions with the girl he was talking to.  These actions snowball into the first verse which depicts the altercation between Thundercat and a past/current lover after she began to walk away. This line could be a reference to Kendrick’s friend Chad Keaton, who died after complications from a drive-by shooting—and was previously mentioned on “u” from To Pimp A Butterfly. When surrounded by gang culture as Kendrick was in his youth (as he mentioned on Good Kid, Maad City), you have to decide on which side you’re standing on. Do you give in to the inclination to spread violence and become a “killer” or do you fight the bad (“fireman”)? Joe Wurzelbacher, otherwise known as “Joe the Plumber,” was an outspoken conservative and opponent to Obama during his initial 2008 run for president. Wurzelbacher gained his name from the McCain-Palin campaign, expressing desires to buy the plumbing company that he worked for, and exposing then-senator Obama’s views on small business tax.\\n\\nKendrick most definitely has a certain degree of distaste for Joe, considering stark differences in political views. So, he may want to treat his target with the same level of hatred and disgust.\\n\\nIn the next line, Kendrick makes reference to a tool, which can be related to Wurzelbacher either through his title “the Plumber” or his naturally Republican support of a “right to bear arms.” Kendrick Lamar is saying that instead of black people selling “dimes” (meaning $10 worth of drugs), now Black people are making money off “rhymes” (writing and recording in the music industry). In urban neighborhoods, “coming home” means to make a return from an incarceration sentence.\\nA woman’s infidelity was the reason for otherwise rational men to clash, the stereotypical scenario as explained by Tupac.\\n\\nThe rest of the lines are allusions to opposing gang members, and inevitable retaliation. In most cases of gang violence, the motivation is revenge over individual friction, that eventually gets blown out of proportion. For example, on June 5, 1972, a West Side Crip shot and killed a Blood member, Fredrick Garret. That was the first homicide between the two former community protecting organizations. Their bitter rivalry remains to this day.\\n\\nKendrick had a similar experience but being the victim of this, during his adolescence years, he shared it on his autobiographical debut album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, on the opening track, “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter.”\\n\\nPeep the alteration on the letter “C.”\\n\\nI remember when your cousin was coming home\\n[…]\\nUnfamiliar faces make niggas nervous\\nConvicted court cases might hit the surface Kendrick brings to light the dark reality of early indoctrination to a criminal lifestyle by elders in neighborhoods, preying on young and impressionable minds, to establish an adherence.\\n\\nThese kids are usually sent out to do the dirty job and dummy missions. Ofttimes willingly so because they either unaware of the severity of their actions or in an effort to show allegiance to the fore mentioned elders, who at times are the only father figures in their lives. “Lil Homies” as they’re called, are basically urban foot soldiers.\\n\\nKendrick spat something similar, and made it an overarching inner theme of numerical wordplay   on his verse on the Pusha T’s,  “Nosetalgia:”\\n\\n When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten\\nAnd nine times out of ten, niggas don’t pay attention\\nAnd when there’s tension in the air, nines come with extensions Kendrick grew up in Compton, CA, a city blighted by drugs and gang violence. He witnessed people forced into unsavory methods of survival by the pressure of their socioeconomic circumstances—people who learned how to operate in niches. Kendrick recognizes this commonality in his observations of the rest of the world; he sees people working through situations where the odds are unfairly stacked against them, and tips his hat in recognition, so to speak. This is a reference to Turkey’s failed Coup in July 2016.  Kendrick is prepared to rebel against a corrupt government. Reaching the tipping point Thundercat’s girl can’t take the relationship any longer. When you love someone you can lose yourself in that love, feeling the ground vanish from under your feet, free-falling with nothing to hold on to. Thus she need to find answers to the questions she is asking herself, “I need to know why I act this way” Kendrick knows he has committed a grave mistake and says that if he needs to right his wrongs, i.e for justice to be served, he may need to spend time in jail (“the pen”).\\n\\nAlso, notice the homophone, “right” and “write”. To write about his wrongs in a verse , he may need to fill up his pen (with ink).\\n\\nIn “condolences through these palms”, Kendrick continues to use homophones as he pronounces\"palms\" as “poems”, referring to his verses, which again ties back to the “right/write” his wrongs theme.\\n\\nKendrick has similarly explored redemption through his writing in “Alright” and “Poetic Justice.” Kendrick sets up a signal for his friend to fire at this man all of the bullets in the barrel of his gun. Earlier in the verse, the narrator worried that the cousin’s release from prison might unbalance the local gang war. Now it turns out that he wasn’t a criminal, but an army veteran. Most Americans don’t care much about criminals, but have plenty of respect for veterans. This man isn’t their enemy, he’s been serving their country. They’ve made a big mistake.\\n\\nKendrick plays on different meanings of “pen” (penitentiary/write) and different homophones of “right”. He’s not just “righting” his wrongs, but also literally writing them down in a verse.',\n",
       " 2965854: 'Referring to the Gundam Cafe (ガンダムカフェ) in Akihabara, Tokyo, revealing to the listener how obsessed he is with each aspect of Japan. Tokyo is very well-known for it’s vibrant nightlife in which nearly daily, many people will party in bars and clubs until the morning. Not the famous French street but the lesser known Omotesandō (表参道), dubbed as the Tokyo-Champs-Élysées. The island nation of Japan sits in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is known for excellently preparing many types of seafood, especially sushi. It’s well documented that Thundercat is a fan of anime (Japanese cartoons).\\n\\nThundercat has cited anime as something he and frequent collaborator Flying Lotus initially bonded over.\\n\\nAlso, his song “Evangelion” is named after an anime series. Players insert money into a pachinko machine, which is a cross between a pinball machine and a slot machine, and try to score points with tiny steel balls.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT-PWC8_h4M Thundercat names two of the greatest Japanese protagonists of all time – Goku from Dragon Ball and Kenshiro from Hokuto no Ken.\\n\\nGoku is the protagonist of the Dragon Ball series, an alien sent to Earth as a child. Thought Goku is a ‘Saiyan’ sent to destroy the Earth, he grows up having forgotten this objective and comes to view it as his adoptive home. Throughout the anime, Goku defends Earth from many alien threats.\\n\\nKenshiro is the protagonist of Hokuto no Ken, a magna and anime which finds him struggling to survive in a brutal post-apocalyptic wasteland. A stoic warrior, he’s a classic action hero archetype.\\n\\nIn invoking these two famed characters, Thundercat’s telling us the he feels strong and unstoppable – both traits associated with these heroes. Thundercat contextualises his earlier comments about Dragon Ball Z, explaining how it is that he came to be a fan of the show.\\n\\nThe line “Goku fucking ruined me” might be a reference to his fandom – in introducing him to Goku and the rest of the Dragon Ball crew, the dentist inadvertently took hours and hours off his life – hours he spent watching Dragon Ball. Aokigahara, also known as the ‘suicide forest,’ is a forest on the northwestern flank of Japan’s Mount Fuji. It is internationally known as one of Japan’s most popular suicide destinations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThundercats desire to “hide” in the forest suggests that he himself might have wanted to commit suicide to avoid the guilt of his previous actions. The line-punctuating exclamation of “shit!” suggests he’s reconsidered, likely spooked by the thought of the forest itself. A reference to the classic “over 9000” meme. According to online meme encyclopaedia Know Your Meme, the quote comes from the 21st episode of Dragon Ball Z, titled “The Return Of Goku.” The phrase itself, spoken by Vegeta, is apparently the product of a poorly-translated dub. The power level is a recurring reference in the Dragon Ball franchise.\\n\\n\\n\\nThundercat has been unabashed in indulging his ‘nerdier’ interests – he mentions video games Diablo and Mortal Kombat on Drunk track “Friend Zone.” It’s worth noting that Thundercat has named his cat, at least in part, after this very quote:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/thundercat/status/643847026430623744\\n\\nIn making this reference, he joins a long procession of hip-hop artists who have referenced Dragon Ball in their work!',\n",
       " 2965857: 'In this song Thundercat echoes Pink Floyd. The B side of Piper at the Gates of Dawn begins with “Interstellar Overdrive,” which is a song meant to make the experience of space travel vivid to the listener. The last song on the B side is “Bike,” an expression of acid inventor Albert Hofmann’s famous bike ride that he took when, in order to discover its effects, he took a dose of acid himself. Continuing the sentiment from the previous lines, Thundercat wishes he could just go to space and escape problems like police brutality. Police brutality has been a problem for some time in the communities of people of color. Even if Thundercat does the right thing and avoids criminal activities, police might still harass him for no reason other than his skin color.',\n",
       " 2965859: 'Originally released in 1992, Mortal Kombat was an arcade-style fighting game later released for home use for most consoles. One of the game’s characters was named Johnny Cage which Thundercat alludes to in this lyric.\\n\\nSome have misheard the lyric as:\\n\\nI wanna love like Johnny Cage\\n\\nbut Thundercat confirmed the lyric via Twitter:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/thundercat/status/847806512512806912?lang=en This woman is not worth his time unless she’s bringing something to the table. Tacos, at the least, but preferably her “taco,” a sophomoric euphemism for vagina.\\n\\nThe suggestion is that he’s not interested in enjoying her company for its own sake, that is, being (just) friends. Thundercat is known to wear a slightly unconventional, somewhat wild, and often changing hairstyle. Thundercat, aka Stephen Bruner, admires this person immensely, but he feels as though his admiration goes unnoticed. In this instance, he starts off by making his dissatisfaction known passive aggressively. Diablo is a role playing video game series, where the player flights different monsters. However, there is a prevailing belief that men who are heavily into video games can be emotionally unavailable in relationships. Usually any text message sent late at night is considered an invitation to a booty call. It’s best to say what you mean though, because mixed signals are the worst to have to decipher. While Thundercat sees devoting his time to another person as bad for his health, his lifestyle of playing excessive video games and drinking are the real physical detriments. On the side of mental health, he has clearly shown that alone time is more pleasurable to him than committing himself to another person, making the woeful “friendzone” tale nonsensical. Thundercat reaffirms the irony presented in the last stanza by saying this ambiguous interest “play[s] too many games” when he himself is the one so insistent on not compromising video games for a relationship. People (usually straight men) whose sexual or romantic advances get turned down sometimes complain about being in the “friendzone” which is often criticised  for perpetuating male entitlement. If your friends don’t want to date you or have sex with you, they’re not being unfair, you just want different things.\\n\\nOne of the stereotypes associated with the “nice guys” who complain about getting stuck in the friendzone is that they play a lot of video games. With over 30 million units sold, Diablo III is one of the bestselling video games of all time.\\n\\nBy channeling the stereotype of a sexless gamer, Thundercat self-deprecatingly pokes fun at the idea of the “friendzone.” “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe” is a 2012 song by Thundercat’s close collaborator, Kendrick Lamar. On that track, Kendrick raps:\\n\\nSometimes I need to be alone\\nBitch, don’t kill my vibe!\\nBitch, don’t kill my vibe!\\n\\nHere, Thundercat invokes the track name to ward off his ex’s bad vibes. It’s another way of saying he’s done with her – he can’t have her around, constantly throwing off his mood.',\n",

Here, Wiz puts in a plug for his third studio album Blacc Hollywood (2014). This is a reference to “Love Sosa” by Chief Keef, who Wiz has collaborated with before.

       " 2965864: 'It looks like Cat is getting into some existentialism, especially when he sees the inhumanity of those who scoff at the notion that black people are fully human.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/7YDTDIIq_Yo?t=13m39s\\n\\nThis line also echoes “Jameel’s Space Ride.” In both songs, Thundercat alludes to the philosophical view that humans are meant to take the enlightenment further, and that the next step in this process is to go into space. This view is known as cosmic transhumanism. Another way to state the view is that in order to become fully human, we must use science and technology to escape limitations such as irrational human prejudices and our dependence on the environment.\\n\\nPerhaps Thundercat is inspired by Afrofuturism, a tradition with roots that go back to Sun Ra. Pharrell says “If you scared of different then you should not take the same path” and then looks to the sun and space. Thundercat says he wants to escape police who hate black people, and then looks to the sun and space. Sun Ra believed that black people must get into space to escape\\nboth oppression and the end of the world. Pharrell is known for rocking camo clothing. In addition to wearing camo outfits of his own, Pharrell has collaborated with Adidas to create a pair of colorful camo leggings and a skirt with the same pattern.\\n\\nM * A * S * H is a TV show that aired from 1972 to 1983. It centers around the staff of a army hospital during the Korean War who use humor to deal with the harsh reality at hand.\\n\\nEcstasy is often referred to as “the love drug” for it’s ability to heighten sensory details such as touch or sight. However, Pharrell is most likely suggesting that any aggressors seek love and happiness instead of violence. This correlates to the previous line of one making sure they have the “right Jordan sneakers on.”\\n\\nThundercat exaggerates the Jordan-less individual’s humiliation by saying that they will be left dead in the gutter. In a society that values money above all, the working class feel pressured to buy things they don’t need to convey a sense of wealth. Despite being luxury items, those who don’t buy these status symbols are often mocked and cast out – often by the people in their own social class.\\n\\nIn today’s society, we’ve all been compelled to buy into consumerism, in the feeling that we are “lesser” and “not right” if we don’t do so, or that we must buy products like this just to fit in because consumerist products have been marketed so much to such a wide audience that it feels abnormal not to have them, where the use of imagery, or something of materialistic attraction is deliberately over-emphasized or focused on in an obsessive fashion to the point where it could even be perceived to be brainwashing. Pharrell is condemning the fact that people use race and sexual preference as tools for ongoing division. Pharrell points out that our basic needs unite us as humans, despite the minor differences in how we choose to meet them.\\n\\nThis is also could be a play on the idiomatic english proverb, “You can’t have your cake and eat it (too),” which literally means “you cannot simultaneously retain your cake and eat it.”\\n\\nBlack and white people, or queer and straight people, are seemingly polar opposites with historical and contemporary conflict, who are always in constant pursuit for a viable solution with the other side. However, true social change is not without compromise, which is a prospect neither sides are willing to face, hence a paradox. “All Lives Matter” is a slogan associated with the criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement, claiming it overlooks the importance of people of other races. However, the two are not meant to be polar opposites, as clarified by the co-founder of Black Lives Matter movement:\\n\\nBlackLivesMatter doesn’t mean your life isn’t important–it means that Black lives, which are seen as without value within White supremacy, are important to your liberation.\\n\\nThundercat in an interview with FactMag commented on what “Black Lives Matter” means to him:\\n\\nYou know, the struggle’s real. Having to say “Black Lives Matter” – who the fuck has to do that? It’s fucked up. Nobody has to prove their worth on a consistent basis, but as a black guy you’re always left trying to prove that you’re worth it, that you’re a person. People keep telling you that you’re not, like you’re supposed to take the shit. That’s bullshit, absolute bullshit. Thundercat calls on Captain Planet, a cartoon character who protects the earth from pollution, to fix the “mess we’ve made.” Referring to thickening racial tensions, Pharrell uses a double entendre to address the real problems. On one hand, he’s saying that the actual problem is in “class” meaning the classes in society—the 1% percent ruling the rest.\\n\\nOn the other hand he  shows that the war is in a classroom, the classroom being everyday life. Our constant media consumption is packed with propaganda that drives wedges between groups with different racial and/or societal identities.\\n\\nThis propaganda is fed to us through our TV’s and phones, common appliances in this day and age. Pharrell realizes, just as the “they” do, that it’s easiest to reach us this way since this is the Information Age. He also realizes that these powers are being abused to alter our view and shift our focus from the real issues.',\n",
       " 2965865: 'Death has long been a concern of Thundercat’s, informed by his own experiences with loss. His close friend and collaborator Austin Peralta died after combining pneumonia with a cocktail of alcohol and drugs. He was 22. His 2015 mini-LP, The Beyond / Where The Giants Roam, is a 16-minute exploration of death and the afterlife. It’s likely that Peralta’s death helped inform that record.\\n\\nThundercat also revisits death multiple times on Drunk, though it’s largely a lighter fare than its predecessor. “Lava Lamp,” “Jethro” and “Blackkk” all make explicit references to death and dying. Drunk is, in a way, circular. Whilst “DUI” and “Rabbot Ho” utilise the same melody, they’re also thematically linked through the titular drunkenness.\\n\\nIn saying there’s “one more glass to go,” Thundercat starts his drinking anew. If we link this to the beginning of the album, where he resolves to “go hard, get drunk, and travel down a rabbit hole,” it’s the beginning of yet another drunken journey.\\n\\nHe’s started a glass, finished it, and started another – perhaps itself symbolic of an onslaught of drunken nights. Living in a world filled with relationship problems, systematic racism, and even good friends with which to drink, who can blame him? In the end, Thundercat’s very aware of his own flaws, ultimately commenting:\\n\\nWhere this ends we’ll never know…',\n",
       " 3006058: 'With the Verse before explaining that the new life they have to face will last with them forever, it seems that the events in their new life will be partially made because of their old life disappearing, meaning that the events happening now can be described as “Children of forever” although it would be very confusing and semi-facetious to call it as such. A better way of describing it would be\\n“New life forever. Things, be mine forever”\\nThis also is an allusion to Stanley Clarke’s 1973 Album “Children Of Forever.” Stanley Clarke is also a bassist just like Thundercat This shows the struggles of life, and how you can’t lie when you’re on your knees praying for things to go better, you’re bearing your soul out when you have a struggle that’s debilitating to the point where you’re praying to god for things to go better, meaning you can’t lie very easily. The struggle in this case, is probably by choice, the person in this song has chosen a path in life that’s led them down a darker road and is struggling now because of it, praying on their knees that things go better. They’re down at the bottom of the bottle, a play on words from the more familiar phrase “Bottom of the barrel” and how the situations and places they know are going to be gone tomorrow and their new life is going to stay with them forever. The first two lines also indicate that the possible struggle could be a close friend to this person who committed suicide and the fallout that comes afterwards showing that what they had with this friend is now gone, and their new life without them is going to have long lasting effects and be with this person forever. But what that does it effectively change the whole Verse from a personal struggle by choice, to dealing with the fallout that comes from the death of a close friend and having to deal with the emotional impact Mac Miller is amazed and really loves the sounds of Thundercat’s instruments. It also can have a connotation, that the sound can give out a sort of message that only musicians like Mac Miller could understand With the first verse showing the aspects of what Mac Miller sees in life. The bridge by Thundercat shows the first verse can also be attributed to sex, as a “heavy load” seems to be a very large cumshot. A “Heavy load” can also mean a very large amount of work, and with Mac Miller being a famous singer/songwriter, there is certainly a lot of work he has to do. “Watch it all unfold” can also be one of three things:\\n\\n1: That with the lyrics being about sex, meaning after he’s finished having interactions with this person, he see’s it all unfold from sexual pleasure for escapism, back the same old reality he was in before\\n\\n2: That with the amount of work being made, it can be done and will result in success\\n\\n3: That with the amount of work being made, it can’t be done and will result in failure In life, we sometimes don’t have enough time to get things done before we cross the rainbow gates. As shown with the lyrics, in a life that feels short there are only so many things to do, so what Mac Miller is listing out in the lyrics are the essentials of what he sees in life and how he should format it into his own story, with him saying “Enough with the questions” meaning he doesn’t want those sacred seconds to be spoiled on useless people and words The lyrics represent events in life that happen with you. It shows that you can change things “as it should” be, but you can’t change the fundamental events of life, love, birth and death. As the final lyric points out, often in life we don’t have a choice but to go through the same events over and over again, leaving us in a cycle of confusion, changing aspects, and perception',\n",

This is a common theme in hip-hop. Maxo paints a detailed picture of his tragic family situation. The drug game brought down all his loved ones. This could be a possible reference to NFL Cartel Bo who was arrested after the release of his music video “Hoova” which featured Maxo.  After NFL Cartel Bo was released on bond he cut his ankle monitor off and has not been seen by authorities since. Maxo is saying he tried to visit his friends and family but they wouldn’t let him in. Because of this they can only talk through letters. Maxo begins the chorus by reflecting on the unwanted consequences of his lifestyle choices: dead and incarcerated family and friends.\\n\\nMaxo further continues by elaborating on what seems like a never ending cycle of said family and friends being released from jail, and others, unfortunately, doing time. This line is the inverse of a line from Roddy Ricch’s 2018 song “Die Young”.:\\n\\nI rather be judged by 12, than carried by six\\n\\nThe line refers to 6 people carrying one’s coffin after a funeral and 12 members of a jury who determine the verdict of a court case.

Shit like that.\\n\\nLimeWire was pretty cool as long as you downloading music. It’s when I try to download Grand Theft Auto III, try to download games, but see I’m so dumb, I tried downloading on a normal CD-ROM. I didn’t know what the fuck I was doin'.

And some niggas ran in tryin' to rob him, and I don’t know what he was thinkin' … he, “Hey, hey, don’t shoot, don’t shoot.” And he put his hand in front of the gun. Really, the nigga was just tryin' to rob him, like, “Give it up.” He put his hand in front of the gun, they blew his shit. I remember I just come home from school; he had like a cast on. But it was a hole in his hand. I was like ugh. I just asked him, “Yo, what happened to your hand?” He like, “I broke it.”\\n\\nHe used to lie to me for the longest time, him and my mama some lyin' motherfuckers, sayin' he broke his hand. Then I remember my brother Jude … him and my older brother Jude got into it and Jude like “Yo, bitch-ass nigga, that’s why he got shot.” And then me and my little brother do like “oooo, he got shot.” And then I found out the story. My first time shooting a gun, I was like 13, but I was shooting it with my neighbor that had a shotgun. And like for Fourth of July, they was hella country ghetto type shit. Like, we were poppin' firecrackers. And I remember my dad was in the yard, like the whole neighborhood. And once he went in the crib or whatever, I started bustin' the gun, like … I went, “Hey, bro, can I see it?” And like yeah. Boom. Boom. Boom. And then like the police had came, we had ran in they house, you feel me? I’m leanin' out the window, they tryin' to see what’s going on, they knockin' on the doors like “yeah, we heard gunshots.” And then my neighbor, he goin' off on me like, “Man, y'all profilin'. This all kinda firecrackers. Woo-woo. Y'all just gonna come sayin' it’s gunshots.” Yeah, I remember that shit. It was a pistol grip pump. A lot of motherfuckers, they just be talkin' like, nigga talk about some, “I get the dope on the boat. I got the dope in my coat.” Nigga, how the fuck you … where? Niggas talkin' bout they got a zip of Xans. How the fuck you get a zip of Xanax? That shit don’t even make sense. Niggas talkin' ‘bout, “Yo, somethin’ somethin' re-rock.” What is re-rock? Tell me what re-rock is. These skateboard-ass, hipster-ass niggas takin' the gangsta shit and tryin' to sound cool and they sound stupid as hell. When I was growin' up, teardrops and face tats was for like real killas. Like, if a nigga had a face tat, I couldn’t even look him in the eye or something ‘cause he was a real crazy-ass nigga. Nowadays, nigga got a face tat, oh, he’s a hypebeast, Soundcloud-ass, internet-ass rapper. Probably got some dirty-ass Vans and probably got Lil Somethin’ in his name or somethin', you know what I’m sayin'?\\n\\nI guess it’s like a fad, like some cool shit. I feel like, even how they call it trap rap, they talkin' about trap, they sound like crackheads and drug dealers. I mean crackheads and junkies. It’s like all the little suburb skate kids tryin' to take all the gangsta shit and make it weak. Water that shit down. That’s exactly what it mean. Yeah, it’s like the little flip phones. You get like a Nascar design or some shit on it. It basically was a chirp. When somebody chirpin', that shit go off louder than a motherfucker. So you didn’t even have to use the phone. It was like a walkie-talkie. A phone walkie-talkie. You chirp somebody. So, like, you can’t get it tapped and you can really say whatever the fuck you want. Shit like that. Without actually going through the phone line. I grew up in southwest Alief, Texas. You get the best of both worlds. Half of it fucked up, but half of it like good living. I got like both.

Girl and guy get hitched with few complications, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell… just as you would expect from Romeo and Juliet… you are going to have to expect some complications, hence the previous and next versus… When they met up, she confessed how sad being apart from him made her. She admits she spends her time waiting for him, and asks whether she’s second guessing everything.\\n\\n“Is this in my head? I don’t know what to think” could be an allusion to Juliet’s thoughts during the Balcony Scene, which is the second scene of the second act. In the scene, after realizing that Romeo has heard her confess her love and admiration for him, she begins to question herself, “I should have been more strange, I must confess” (II.ii.107). He’s already asked her dad for permission and they can finally get married.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that, folks, is why you don’t rely on Taylor Swift to help you write your high school book report on Romeo and Juliet. When she uses the term “scarlet letter,” she is implying that she is a kept secret. If they were found out, she would be an embarrassment to her family. Juliet was cut off from her family midway through the play when she refused her father’s ‘generosity’ by not accepting the marriage he had arranged for her.\\n\\nTaylor also said in an interview (that has since been removed), that many books, such as The Scarlet Letter, have influenced her songwriting.\\n\\nI was a big fan of a fairy tales growing up, and you’ll see a lot of references to like Romeo and Juliet and The Scarlet Letter, and that’s from my reading.\\n\\nSwift evokes The Scarlet Letter again in her single “New Romantics” and re-contextualizes the scarlet letter as a badge she can proudly display singing:\\n\\nWe show off our different scarlet letters, /trust me mine is better They pretend they’re not in Verona, (the setting of Romeo and Juliet) where they can’t be together because of the feuding between the their two families. They imagine they are somewhere else, where the two could be in love and get married. In a modern setting, it would be them sneaking away for some alone time. Since Juliet is only thirteen, her parents are protective of her, and would be highly suspicious if she suddenly started going out alone. As a result, she can’t leave the house to see Romeo unless she was going to church, which is the one place she was truly allowed to go by herself.\\n\\nTo get around this obstacle, Juliet would sit out on her balcony at night and Romeo would go into the garden underneath it. The pair first do this in the second scene of the second act, and it proves to work for them. However, they have to be quiet, otherwise her parents will notice. When Romeo and Juliet meet at a Capulet party in the fifth scene of the first act, Juliet is unaware that Romeo is a Montague. When she learns this, she is shocked to realize she has fallen for an enemy of her family.\\n\\nIn the play, Romeo never throws pebbles to get Juliet’s attention, so Taylor either added this cute detail herself, or meant that falling for him was risky. If someone were to throw rocks instead of pebbles, it could break the window. This would be incredibly dangerous for the two star-crossed lovers, because a broken window would instantly give away their secret love.\\n\\nTaylor is no stranger to throwing rocks — she discusses it in her song “Hey Stephen.” She later discussed having rocks and bricks thrown at her in “Ours” and “New Romantics” — metaphorically this time. The Capulets and the Montagues had an ancient feud which forbade them from loving each other. Juliet’s father disapproved of Romeo and his family, and actually arranged a marriage for Juliet with another man. She has a protective father so this is how it reflects in a modern setting.\\n\\nHowever, in the original play, Juliet’s parents had no idea about Romeo, so they couldn’t truly disapprove of their relationship. Lord Capulet didn’t even particularly dislike Romeo, shown when he shows up to a party the Montagues weren’t invited to. Juliet’s cousin Tybalt was the only person who was bothered by Romeo’s presence. Romeo and Juliet meet in the fifth scene of the play’s first act. Juliet’s family, The Capulets, are hosting a party and Romeo and some of his friends attend, hoping to go unnoticed. Taylor places herself on Juliet’s balcony, one of the most iconic settings of the play. The best-known scene that takes place here is the second scene of Act 2, often dubbed “the balcony scene.” At this point in the play, Romeo and Juliet have fallen in love with each other, and Juliet is daydreaming about him. Little does she know, Romeo is in the garden below her, listening to every word she says.\\n\\nFor the song’s live performance on the Speak Now tour, Taylor was literally standing there — she flew over the crowd in a replica of Juliet’s balcony! In Shakespeare’s classic play, Romeo and Juliet were both teenagers when they met and fell in love, with Juliet being thirteen and Romeo being seventeen.\\n\\n\\n\\nTaylor herself was young at the time of the song’s release. Born on 13 December, 1989, Taylor would have been 19 at the time of the song’s release.',\n",
       " 3945870: 'The two Atlanta rappers ‘Gunna’ and ‘Lil Baby’ have a long history with the word ‘Drip’, and are thought by many to be the main ambassadors of the word. It is even incorporated into all of Gunna’s previous album titles; “Drip Season, Drip Season 2, Drip or Drown, Drip Season 3\"\\n\\nEssentially, the word can be thought to mean a persons clothing or visual appearance, and is similar to that of ‘swag’ or ‘sauce’. In some cases it is can also be used to describe diamond jewelry due to the way it shines like water when in light.\\n\\nGunna has a very simple definition of the word which he told Billboard during an interview in 2018:\\n\\nDrip is your attire, the clothes you wear.\\n\\nHe later goes on to talk about his passion for clothing and its effect of his life:\\n\\nOn God I always had a passion for clothes […] My mama will tell you I used to get dressed three or four times a day as a kid, just putting shit on. This is the producer tag, which is used in songs to give credit to the producer, Turbo. Turbo is from Atlanta and works with Lil Baby and Gunna frequently. He even produced 9 of 13 tracks on Drip Harder. Lil Baby knows adversaries are acting hostile towards him, but he doesn’t read social media comments, so it doesn’t affect his attitude in an negative way, but instead shows him that they’re jealous of his success and fame. Patek Philippe SA is a luxury Swiss watch manufacturer. Their prices range from around $20,000 all the way up to $11 million. The high price tag has made them a hip-hop trope, with Lil Baby himself repeatedly mentioning them, like on his July 2017 song “Dates”:\\n\\nFlooded Pateek, flooded Patek, whatever you call it In America, companies use yellow caution signs to warn people that the floor is wet. It helps in court, in case someone sues for a slip and fall.\\n\\n\\n\\nGunna uses this ubiquitous wet floor sign as a symbol to warn those of all his jewelry, which is often called ice and water. Some examples of hard-to-spell brand names that Gunna has rapped about include:\\n\\n\\nYves Saint Laurent, which he mentioned on Young Thug’s August 2018 track, “Chanel (Go Get It).” The company uses the acronym YSL, which is also the name of Young Thug’s record label, although his acronym stands for Young Stoner Life.\\nGivenchy, a French clothing line he name drops on his February 2018 track “Oh Okay.”\\nHermés, a French brand known for its leather goods which he shouts out on April 2018’s “Sold Out Dates.”\\nGiuseppe Zanotti an Italian shoe designer he raps about on Young Thug’s August 2016 track, “Floyd Mayweather.”\\nGoyard, another French designer known for its luxury pouches, which he brags about on the November 2017 track, “Drip or Drown.” Lil Baby, like many of his trap contemporaries, hails from Atlanta, Georgia. He’s signed to Atlanta based record label Quality Control Music, which counts amongst others, the Migos on its roster. All of the label’s signees were under 27 at the time of this song’s release.\\n\\nA contemporary of Baby’s is also fellow Atlanta rapper, Young Thug, whose YSL signee Gunna also hails from Atlanta, and is 25. Gunna doesn’t want somebody else giving him jewelry because he’s rich enough to afford his own. However, slaves also wear chains around their necks and ankles, which are the types of chains Gunna does not want. Chanel is a French luxury brand identifiable by its logo of interlocking C’s. The retail price for Chanel designer purses starts around $5,000.\\n\\nLil Baby interpolates the chorus to Young Thug’s “Chanel (Go Get It),” on which he featured. On the chorus, Young Thug raps:\\n\\nShe want Chanel, go get it, she want Chanel, go get it\\nShe want this Fendi, go get it, she want a Birkin, go get it\\n\\nLike Thug, Baby is not concerned with the price tag when it comes to what his girl wants. TSA is short for “Transportation Security Administration,” a government task force stationed at every airport in United States. They may perform more thorough investigations on people carrying large amounts of money and jewelry.',\n",
       " 58043: \"Childish Gambino has previously stated that this is his favorite verse on Camp\\nhttps://youtu.be/Lgko-xReFSs?t=3m47s He’s the best the girl has ever had sexually/romantically. Also, a reference to “Best I Ever Had”. Gambino is frequently compared to Drake, being that they are both black actors-turned-rappers. This is not lost on CG; see “Bonfire”. He’s a ghost meaning he’s not around anymore and that he’s a travelin' man, which is why they broke up in the first place (a theme Drake, Kanye West, and Hank Williams have also expressed in song). This also makes him an emotional ghost. He also flips an accusation she had of him: she accused him of being a ghost while they were together, and now that he is a ghost, she only wants him back. Double meaning:\\n\\n\\nShe’s changed. The person she is now isn’t the person she was when she was with him. Even though he’s inside her (and knowing her Biblically), he can’t know her.\\nIn the sexual sense, “I can’t find you” is being used in a manner similar to the way he used the phrase here. He’s no longer able to satisfy her sexually the way he could when they were together.\\nMentally, this girl isn’t with him.  It’s ironic that while he’s literally inside her he is kept emotionally at a distance. He isn’t used to not knowing what this girl is thinking.\\nHe can’t physically find her because she’s avoiding him. Hey man, have you seen that girl? That girl that I once had? CG doesn’t care and yet he does (the crux of this song is feeling simultaneous contradictory impulses about a lover). A lot of people couldn’t care less about who their ex is sleeping with (whose dicks she’s sucking), but Gambino actually does care.\\n\\nAlso, “ate” here could be heard as ‘ate–a contracted form of “hate.” He’s saying he knows that she’s telling him lies by claiming to dislike guys she actually does like when she’s around him, and he doesn’t have the time of day for this tedious pantomime. The problem in the previous line is not good, it is bad.\\n\\nThis could be a play on “right/left” vs. “right/wrong.” If he’s in a threesome, like the earlier line suggests, he has a lady on his right and left, but instead of being right and left, it’s right and wrong, as he knows the threesome wasn’t a good decision. The politics of a breakup often include who can hurt the other person the most. He’s upset and needs to be by himself, like he has been since she broke up with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay also be a reference to his song “Be Alone.” Childish Gambino (real name Donald Glover) is primary character in the NBC show Community which airs late Thursday nights.\\n\\nThursday is also a very popular night to go out (see: The Weeknd) This dude is old news since he was capped on May 2, 2011\\n\\n\\n\\nSo stop rapping about him, and this girl needs to stop hiding the fact that she used to date Gambino.\\n\\nIncidentally, Bin Laden did a lot of hiding in the years leading up to his death, which, according to the line above this one, was one thing CG and his girl had in common.\\n\\nHere’s one dated rap about Bin Laden: Immortal Technique and Mos Def’s song called, well, “Bin Laden”):\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdagSIa-UQ8 The straightforward interpretation would be to assume that the artichoke is the penis, and “smoke and light” (as in at a concert) mean success. He has a heart but girls want successful men’s penises.\\n\\n“Artichoke” could also be a play on “art of choke,” as in choking a woman while having sex, a kink that, for example, Kanye has mentioned fondly. CG is saying that he misses tender sex (“where you kiss whenever you’re through”), but that some girls–like this ex–are only looking for a violent hookup now that he’s not in a relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn artichoke has layers of green (CG has stacks of money) which surround a colorful center (heart). CG too has a tender center, (I got a heart), but girls are only interested in the exterior, i.e. the green/money.\\n\\nReally approaching the artichoke metaphor from all angles, an artichoke is a lot like an inverted flower, green and rough on the exterior and colorful/sweet on the inside.  Gambino draws a parallel to himself with this, implying that he is spiteful over the social stigma that men who display their “color”/heart on the exterior are in some way less masculine. Many women idealize the bad boy persona and if they don’t, it’s still generally recognized as socially unusual for men to express emotions as openly as women.  And when men do express emotions, they are often socially castrated.\\n\\nLearning that attaining the affection of women is often inversely related to how kindly you treat her or how good of a person you are is an idea that informs one of this album’s overarching themes. “Two can play that game”: A proverb that states that the tactics and/or strategies of an enemy can be used against him.\\n\\nBobby Brown helped popularize the phrase with his 1992 single entitled identically with the proverb. Super Smash Brothers is a popular franchise of fighting games made by Nintendo that features Nintendo characters, such as Mario or Kirby.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, CG plays on words by saying the girl sarcastically asks if she should go “play” with the Super Smash Brothers(fuck other dudes, probably his friends) in response to how her partner slipped off in a threesome. It’s pretty obvious that neither of the brothers will be him.\\n\\nGambino also uses some wordplay here with “none of them you”. This is a double entendre for “none of them Mew”. Mew is the rarest Pokemon assist available in the game, which is a metaphor for the girl this song is dedicated to. Nostalgia! The relationship is over but they still have feelings for each other, and this kind of situation typically results in sex, as it does here.\",\n",
       " 2836122: 'he’s angry at his brother for killing himself and is asking him he’s happy he’s finally dead, in a way that means underneath that he’s broken because of the suicide He probably left his family so he could recollect himself. He probably blames himself and needs to find a way to help get rid of the feeling of lose and regret He is blaming everything on him and saying maybe I caused this because I wasn’t there or to show you a better way “Hiding Behind Youth” is referring to a person shielding their bad thoughts into the back of their  head as that is what young minds tend to do, to push optimism to it’s limit. Suicidal people can’t see themselves getting the strength to end it until something pushes them over the edge. This is Joyner’s friends way of saying he doesn’t want to talk to people. He lives in his head because he’s the only one he confides with. People say suicide is the cowards way out. But in reality the people dealing with these thoughts have been dealing with them for ages and it wears them down. They are strong but become weak over time. Depressed people who are suicidal often seem to think that their lives are insignificant, or even detrimental to those around them. In the words of 50 Cent “Death’s got to be easy because life is hard.”\\nIn the mind of somebody with a mental illness, it just seems easier to let go of everything than it does to keep fighting through the punches life is throwing at you. This is a perfectly rational thought in the mind of a mentally ill person, though it might seem outlandish and unthinkable to a non-ill person looking from the outside. This is Joyner describing what it feels like, as someone with a mental disorder, to be teased, bullied, belittled, and pitied for their condition and how being behind (whether in school, finding a job, cleaning house, taking care of yourself, etc.) can become saddening and put you into a cycle of constantly ignoring duties and responsibilities, all the while mentally agonizing over them. The latter two lines also references the tendency of those without mental disorders to try to offer advice and be helpful to a mentally ill person, only to turn around and criticize that person for their shortcomings due to the illness (e.g. executive dysfunction that is perceived as “laziness”). In a clever spin on the lines from the first verse, Joyner explains how he feels about his friend’s suicide by twisting the words that were in his suicide note. Joyner wonders how they couldn’t have sorted this out, a recurring theme in the song.\\n\\nIn this part of the music video, Joyner literally tries to rip his friend out of his casket, showing that his emotions are true. Joyner is depressed that despite all his help, his friend still killed himself. Oftentimes many people become angry at the suicidal for killing themselves and causing large amounts of grief to the people who they knew.\\n\\nThis behavior is actually extremely common among all forms of grief, being the second stage of the Kübler-Ross model, often referred to as “the five stages.” Joyner in fact goes through all of these stages throughout his verse and tries to reflect how his emotions changed over his friend’s death. In the Bible it is said that:\\n\\nIf you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer – Matthew 21:22\\n\\nBut some people are having trouble with their lives and sometimes they think they don’t believe in God enough because trouble keeps coming to them.\\n\\nThis line sounds a little bit similar to what Eminem said in “Rock Bottom”:\\n\\nI pray that God answers – maybe I’ll ask nicer Because his pen had no more ink, he couldn’t finish his suicidal note; he crumbles up the letter in the music video. He tells the reader that he continued writing it the next day confirming the suicide is something he wants to do.\\n\\nEven though it’s a new day however, the reader still didn’t have time because he’s reading the end of his suicide note.\\n\\nThis line might also be a reference to the 2015 commercial mixtape by Drake “If You’re Reading This Its Too Late.” Grief can be an intense and unpleasant process. Joyner’s peaking in anger and emotion at this point. His sentences become fractured, reflecting his scattered and sporadic thoughts. He repeats a lot of his sentences to add emphasis or simply because he is overwhelmed and those sentiments are all he can think of at the moment. In the middle of his sentence, Joyner halts and showcases some frustration at the thought of what his friend had done. He thinks back to reading the suicide note, feeling bothered at both its contents and the fact that there was nothing he could’ve done to help his friend through his dark patch. He’s treating his time at his friend’s open casket like a confessional, ready to release his frustrations and speak about what has happened and the events leading up to it.\\n\\nHe doesn’t want his words to be wasted however. He’s hoping that this person’s spirit is close by and  listening, as he has quite a few things he would like to make clear. He’s been suicidal for an extremely long time, which is contributing to why he’s feeling so down. “Stay out the fire” could also sound like “stay out the fight”, referring to how he’s prone to getting into trouble with other kids at school or just in general\\n\\n\\n\\nHis grandma was always trying to encourage him to take it easy, and he wonders if her advice was any real help to him. Considering where he is now.\\n\\nThe mentioning of grandma also implies she raised them because either the parents were not able to or were dead. It might also be a proposed reason for the suicidal thoughts Joyner’s friend has. Those with common mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety tend to seclude themselves, often without realizing they’re doing it..\\n\\nThey come to learn that exposing themselves to others is to invite others to voice their concerns, which can make many people uncomfortable. People suffering from clinical depression also have a hard time accepting any sort of affection from others. Depressed people often put on a fake smile when they’re out in public in order to act as if everything is alright. Although this can be exhausting, it is often done to avoid uncomfortable conversations with others who may grow concerned. Speaking in the first person perspective of one who suffers from a mental illness, most likely that of clinical depression, he likens his mind to a maze in which he is constantly lost.\\n\\nHis question likely translates to ‘Do you ever feel like that?’ Or he may be saying that you wouldn’t understand if you haven’t suffered from the same ailment. His pen was running out that he was writing his suicide note with so he needed to get to the point.\\n\\nThis could also represent this person’s time on the Earth. That the ink is running out so the last part of the note is rushed along with the conclusion to pull the trigger. Christians believe that the 10 Commandments are instructions that were written by God himself on Mount Sinai. The sixth commandment is “You shall not murder.”\\n\\nBecause of that, it is common belief that taking away life (even by suicide) is disrespecting God and therefore is punishable by eternal life in hell.\\n\\nHere Joyner also suggests that he has his mind made and is definitely going to kill himself by saying “we gonna” instead of “we might”. “Ordinary People” is a song by John Legend.\\n\\nJoyner’s friend doesn’t feel like he’s “ordinary” or “normal” like everybody else, which makes him feel isolated and alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s also a reference to the movie Ordinary People (1980, dir. Robert Redford); one of the main characters, Conrad, struggles with suicidal thoughts – which have only escalated following his brother’s death in a tragic sailing accident. On August 11, 2014, famous actor and comedian Robin Williams committed suicide in his home in Paradise Cay, California.\\n\\nJoyner’s friend has decided that he’s going to follow in Robin’s footsteps and take his own life.\\n:(',\n",
       " 3095181: \"Joyner is going to light a cigarette to calm down while he waits for his plug. This is interesting because he has clearly bought drugs from the plug before as later indicated in the verse, where he invited him into his car. Moreover, it implies that Lucas is still nervous for the transaction, and he is not totally used to his lifestyle. When Lucas says ‘bud’, he’s clearly referring to marijuana, but the interesting part is that he is not satisfied with just weed, but also wants some pills. The term ‘pills’ is super vague, but he could be referring to downers like Xanax or other sedatives This is the Voicemail heard when calling Joyners Phone Number (508-507-2209), which is also his Albums title.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXDHCMwIxZ4 The stripper in the story is tired of her job, and she turns to cocaine to deal with her stress.\\n\\n“Snow White” is a metaphor for cocaine, as the names of the Seven Dwarfs can correspond to the end results of cocaine: Grumpy and Happy (mood swings), Sleepy (exhaustion), Bashful and Dopey (alteration of personality), Sneezy (allergies), and Doc (a trip to the doctor).\\n\\nHowever, it is mentioned that she does not have her Seven Dwarfs, which suggests that she takes cocaine so often that she has numbed herself to the effects it gives her.\\n\\n“Heaven’s door” could be either a simple reference to death or a more indepth reference to “Knockin' on Heaven’s Door” by Guns N' Roses. “Knockin' on Heaven’s Door” focuses on a heroin addict who is tired of living his life and who feels like he is near death—almost a perfect description of the stripper in this song, “Keep It 100.” Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of America, is the face printed on the $100 bill. A halfway house is an institution that allows people with physical, mental, and emotional disabilities, or those with criminal backgrounds, to learn (or relearn) the necessary skills to re-integrate into society. As well as serving as a residence, halfway houses provide social, medical, psychiatric, educational, and other similar services. This line originates from the Bible verse 1 Timothy 6:10 which states:\\n\\nFor the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with Almost all voice mails on this album relate to the next song. In the next song  “Winter Blues” Joyner talks about robbing people for money and possessions because he is poor and has no way of obtaining those things. This call from the police officer probably relates to those activities.\\n\\nThis also implies that Joyner Lucas was not the initial man buying drugs, but he was the drug dealer because it was the drug dealer’s number on the bill. Joyner uses a double-entendre in this last line. The stripper pays for gas, eggs, dill, cheese, and milk with the hundred dollar bill of the story. So the cashier will have to give her change, meaning coins and smaller denomination banknotes.\\n\\nHowever, she also needs a change from her current lifestyle. As mentioned earlier in the verse, she doesn’t like stripping and turns to cocaine for relief, but she feels she has to so that she can keep the lights on. This reality of life again emphasizing the song’s theme of “keep it a hundred”.\\n\\nNote also Joyner’s sudden downward vocal inflection when he says this line, betraying its double meaning. This isn’t only a way for Joyner to cheekily promote his album (which is named after this number), but it also relates to Joyner personally.\\nJoyner stated on his Facebook account that 508-507-2209 was the first phone number he ever had, and that he named the album after it to put his city on the map. The clerk recognizes the 100 dollar bill with the number on and assumes that the homeless man is the same man who robbed the store. In the video it shows the clerk pulling out a shotgun before it cuts off. This wraps up the song and consolidates the theme that nothing good comes from money even if it is deserved and comes from honest methods. The term “Keep it a 100” means to be 100% true and honest. This song follows the story of a $100 bill and shows how the lust for money leads so many to dishonest and corrupt actions. Most likely a reference to the infamous Hurricane Betty’s, a local strip club and cornerstone of Worcester night-life. It is about a 3 minute drive from the aforementioned Park Avenue. Park Avenue, or Park Ave, is one of the largest main roads in Joyner’s hometown, Worcester, Massachusetts. Joyner notably pays homage to his city in his debut album’s title, “508-507-2209”, which infers a Worcester-based phone number starting with area code 508.\",\n",

Cardi likely means the rice-based Mexican version, which is sweet and popular in America. She presented a similar theme on her April 2018 cut, “Money Bag” from her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy:\\n\\nThis is sweet pussy Saturday, that’s just what Plies say\\n\\nShe later commented on this line on Twitter, a few days after the song’s release:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1097317317338263554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBruno Mars also teased the official music video through a tweet:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/BrunoMars/status/1100226707846381569 Jodeci is a 90’s R&B quartet whose most notable members include Cedric “K-Ci” Hailey and Joel “Jojo” Hailey.

George Jefferson was a fictional character first played by Sherman Hemsley in American sitcom “All in the Family”, before becoming the protagonist in the show’s spin-off show: “The Jeffersons”.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn his verse, it’s likely that Montana is referring to Jefferson’s move from the Queens borough of New York City to a deluxe apartment in Manhattan.

       " 4453270: \"Sometimes I prayed, let me run away\\n\\nRM tells the listener that, at times, he felt a desire to escape, this escape probably being from his life as an idol.\\n\\nThis is likely due to the various pressures created by constantly being in the spotlight, as the members of BTS would be. The members are perpetually subject to hate, criticism and unnecessary remarks, and must constantly meet the expectations enforced on them by the public in order to fulfil an “idol” image. Elevated sky, expanded halls\\n\\nThe “elevated sky, expanded halls” that RM speaks of refers to the high ceiling and wide space provided by a concert arena.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is possible the sense of importance afforded by the volume of such venues contributed to RM being “a little stuck up” as he admits in the previous lines. Colloquially, the word “high” is often used to describe a feeling of euphoria, and is said to be “often caused by a feeling of success”.\\n\\nBTS may be continuing to address ARMYs, telling them that it is thanks to them that BTS are high on the success they have achieved. I want you tuned in to my eyes/I want to be on eye level with you\\n\\nThis may imply that though their accrual of wealth and fame may indicate otherwise, BTS don’t wish to be above ARMYs, namely wanting to be on the same level as their fans. Now it’s so high up here\\n\\nIn the years closely preceding the release of “Boy With Luv”, BTS' fame has reached new heights—to the point that their rise to success has been described by numerous news source as “world domination”. Everyone says that I used to be so little and now I became a hero (Oh no)\\n\\nj-hope challenges the concept that by having helped so many people through their music, the messages they convey through said music and even their use of social media, BTS are heroes.\\n\\nThemes of heroism and all it entails are prevalent in the lyrics of several BTS songs, particularly in the form of self-comparison with Anpanman, a Japanese cartoon character who has no superpowers but is made of red bean bread, and chooses to offer pieces of himself to those in need:\\n\\nI don’t have biceps or pecs\\nI don’t have a super car like Batman\\nThe ideal hero is my fantasy\\nBut all I can give you is Anpan\\nI’ve dreamed of becoming a hero like Superman\\nI ran with all my strength, jumping high up in the sky\\nI’m not afraid of little things like bruising my knees\\nA innocent fantasy of my childhood\\n\\n\\n\\n“Anpanman”, j-hope, 2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, in “Boy With Luv”, j-hope counters this idea. He does not consider their deeds to have made such a great contribution to humanity that they warrant him being labelled a hero. Rather, j-hope is content with simply bringing happiness, peace and strength to those who need it.\\n\\nIf I\\nSomeone’s strength\\nSomeone’s light\\nI wish I could be a\\nPiece of peace\\n\\n\\n\\n“P.O.P (Piece of Peace) pt.1”, j-hope, 2018 I want to be with you for everything\\n\\nJungkook expresses his appreciation of ARMYs and their companionship. BTS' fans have been with the group despite numerous struggles, such as claims BTS members did not fit the standards of idol beauty, rumours that BTS' company, BigHit Entertainment, had bought their own group’s albums to boost official numbers, and accusations of BTS plagiarising their better-known seniors.\\n\\nFor that, Jungkook is grateful, and he conveys this by telling ARMYs he “[wants] to be with [them] for everything”, just as they were for him and his members. BTS sing that they have “waited all [their] life”, perhaps to be able to connect to a fanbase and share messages of not only sociopolitical criticism, but comfort and hope.\\n\\nBTS' fanbase was initially small and their music of poor visibility, but in 2019 their fanbase is vast enough that they are able to communicate “the things that someone needed to say, but that no one did”, as Suga said in a 2018 interview. Though at a glance these numerically based phrases may seem similar, individually they have subtly different connotations.\\n\\n“The one” is a phrase used to refer to the destined life partner of any given individual.\\n\\nMeanwhile, one’s “number two” refers to a person’s second-in-command, and can be compared in this way to the phrase “right-hand man”.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy deeming himself “your one, your two”, Jin designates himself as both ARMYs' life partner and their second-in-command. Thus, he indicates the relationship between himself and ARMYs as mutual in a way that might not be as evident if he had deigned to sing, “my one, my two”. Come be my teacher\\nTeach me everything about you\\n\\nJin continues to address ARMYs as Jimin and V have in previous lines. In a similar vein to Jimin, who remarks that he is “curious about everything”, Jin expresses an intrigue in “everything about you”, namely ARMYs.\\n\\nJin wishes for ARMYs to communicate to him this information so he can familarize himself with them on a level more personal than that of a typical celebrity-fan relationship. He seeks to learn even seemingly insignificant details, or “every little trivial habit of [ARMYs']” as Suga raps later on in the song. Now, I kinda get it\\n\\nFive years after the release of “Boy in Luv”, BTS have learnt to pursue a romantic relationship in a healthy manner. No longer do they allow rejection or evasion to anger them, as RM describes in “Boy in Luv:\\n\\nYou make me so angry and mad for no reason\\nI’m serious but you make me into a loser, who picks fights with you This idea of pain being a shared experience has been consistent throughout BTS' discography. For instance, in Jungkook’s solo track “Begin,” which was written by RM to embody Jungkook’s experience in BTS, this idea is further explained:\\n\\nI can’t take it anymore\\nBecause you are crying\\nI want to cry in your place\\nAlthough I can’t\\nI feel like dying\\nWhen my brother is sad\\nWhen my brother is sick\\nIt hurts more than when I’m sick\\n\\nThis sense of empathy and compassion for others is a powerful thing that binds people together, and this bind can only be created and strengthened through love. In this lyric, J-Hope references back to his solo track called on his album Hope World called “P.O.P (Piece of Peace) Pt.1”.\\n\\nIf I can become that piece\\nI’ll dole out without a word of protest\\nTo this country first. A tribute to BTS' 2017-2018 Love Yourself era, BTS proclaim the power of love. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said:\\n\\nLove is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable.\\n\\nIn a world of struggles and trouble and hate, love has the power to overcome all if only the people give it the chance. The phrase ‘boy with love’ derives from BTS' 2014 track “Boy in Luv” which laments the hardships of seemingly unrequited love. In the 2014 song they detail themselves changing for the person they love:\\n\\nHow should I change for you? (hold up)\\nPlaying mind games? Two-timing? I don’t know how to do that\\n\\nFast forward five years to “작은 것들을 위한 시 (Boy With Luv),” BTS depict their growth by changing ‘boy in love’ to ‘boy with love’ because they’ve found internal love and inspiration from themselves. It’s because of this that they’ve finally managed to find the love they’ve sought this whole time. In 2016, BTS wrote about the process of reaching one’s potential, or spreading one’s wings, through passion with their Wings album.\\n\\nI believe in myself, my back hurts because\\nIt’s to sprout my wings\\nI believe in you, I may be weak now\\nBut in the end, it will be an incredible jump\\n\\nThree years later, and BTS are still chasing their dreams having attended the Recording Academy Grammy Awards, speaking at the UN, and embarking on a stadium world tour. This line references the Greek myth of Icarus, son of the acclaimed architect Daedalus. Both of them were imprisoned by King Minos to keep the Labyrinth a secret. Daedalus built wings of  feather and wax for him and his son to escape with. Daedalus warns Icarus to not fly to close to the sun, but his son does. As a result, his wings melt off and he falls into the sea.\\n\\nBy referencing this myth, BTS contrast this fate by saying they’ve grown wings, a different reference to their 2016 Wings album, and have flown to those listening and supporting them rather than the sun, which could be a reference to the harsh media spotlight on them.\",\n",

Tierra is saying that when this guy she is dating comes to her for help, she won’t be obliged to accept. This comes from the notion prayer being the last resort when all hope is lost and there’s nothing else that can be done. The significant other that Tierra is referring to is past the point of help, and at this point all she can do is hope that God can help save him because this “only child” is absolutely useless and helpless.

The salon offers more than just general hair care but also a chance for women to gather and socialize. It’s usually an open welcoming space for black women, who typically aren’t allowed to express their anger or sadness without being judged harshly by society.\\n\\nLizzo uses similar analogies in previous songs, e.g. “Coconut Oil.” Lizzo may be referring to an incident in which she was dumped via voicemail by a guy who decided to go back to his ex, whom he left to start dating Lizzo, as she mentioned on Sway https://youtu.be/42-UxJF6n1w?t=13m23s',\n",

Though Texas is literally quite hot with record highs of 120°F (48.8 C), Kacey is likely referring to the stark contrast between her morals and that of her home state.\\n\\nA Gallup poll published in 2018 listed Texas as one of the states with an above average conservative population. However, Kacey has long been known to take a more free approach to life. In March 2018, Kacey posted a picture of her husband and her smoking weed on their wedding night. Just the year before, she posted a tweet about writing a song while on an LSD trip — which turned out to be the track “Mother.” Before she was married, Kacey was also known to kiss a few girls.

I guess it could live in both songs, I mean, I’m the one who made it up so I was like, ‘I can borrow from myself,’ you know? ‘Slow Burn’ is the song that starts the record off and I feel like it’s kinda one of my most autobiographical songs. It’s describing a lot of things about me and my mindset. It just seemed to really fit. But also, like I said, I wasn’t trying to be too discerning about the lyrics this time around, so I just grabbed it from that song and ran with it.

This is a demonstration of her newfound independence. Previously, she’d orbit around her partner, but now she is focusing on healing herself. Even more references to space: “rise and shine” refers to the Sun rising in the morning, while “stars aligning” means that things have fallen into place and a situation is going well.\\n\\nBasically, Ariana will be sleeping in the same bed and waking up next to him (her “rise and shine”) when she’s had some time on her own and things aren’t as difficult for her (“soon as them stars align”).\\n\\nThis line is also reminiscent of a line from the song “pete davidson” off of her album Sweetener:\\n\\nNo better place or a time, (look) how they align / Universe must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap The space shuttle Discovery was the third of five shuttles built by NASA.

Much like how most of the universe is a mystery to NASA, Ari believes that if she spends some time away from her man, she can be a mystery to him.\\n\\nSince its inception in 1968, NASA has only explored an infinitesimal portion of the universe. This is because electromagnetic radiation or light from faraway galaxies and supernovae has not yet reached Earth to allow NASA to use its tools to study it.

Obviously the person he met is attractive, and his friends are aware of her alluring features. He is now realizing that reminiscing over his previous heartbreak isn’t going to get him anywhere when someone new is interested, allowing him to consider the prospect of a recent love interest.

If I do pray, I don’t know who I’m praying to, but I think the idea of prayer is still very beautiful, whoever it is you’re talking to; whether it’s your higher self or your inner voice or your idea of God or whatever. Prayer in the context of community, it interests me as well. But I think in this context it’s a little bit flippant. It’s not really to say ‘You don’t need to pray’ or ‘I don’t need to pray.’ It’s saying: “I feel so fucking satisfied in this situation that I don’t need my usual devices of making myself feel better.” “When you’re done with me, I see negative space,” is actually more positive than you think. It’s to say that someone can make you feel so great that you are in almost a hallucinogenic state, the way you see behind the curtain of reality. In ‘Interstellar,’ do you remember when they’re behind the bookshelves? It’s that concept, of feeling so high off somebody that your perception of reality is changing.

This line foreshadows the pre-chorus, where she reads out the rules.\\n\\nWriting things down is a way of relieving mental stress and this implies that her attachment to her ex is so great, that even though “he doesn’t love [her]” she is still fighting a mental battle to give him up.\\n\\nBy reading it out, it is implying that her attachment to him is preventing her from moving on, so she has to “read it out” to reinforce the truth, to give herself a sort of ‘moral support’. By doing this she is hoping that it will help her move on. The repetition of “one” has shown that the rule that Dua most likely has the biggest struggle with is not picking up the phone (rule #1).\\n\\nThis, also being the intro of the song, might be a reminder that this is the most important rule and if you don’t follow rule #1 it can lead to betraying rules #2 and #3 and falling into something negative.\\n\\nIn an interview with NPR, Dua said\\n\\nThey’re not necessarily rules I’ve been able to stick by…but [they’re] rules that I feel like it’s important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends…There’s a reason people break up, and it’s probably the same reason why you shouldn’t get back together. Her first rule is to not listen to him when he calls her. He’s calling drunk to say all the things she wants to hear, like that he actually loves her, but only to manipulate her so he can get what he wants: sex. She’s aware of the manipulation, but still wants to believe his act.\\n\\nAlcoholics can be more manipulative and have abandonment issues, so it’s not surprising that he only does this when he’s drunk. Dua Lipa uses clever wordplay here. She’s referring to the common sex position “missionary” where the woman is lying underneath the man.\\n\\n\\n\\nDua’s use of metaphor highlights the fact that sleeping with her ex will not help her to get over him; it’ll just make it tougher for her to get away from him.\\n\\nBeing under him could also mean she is being manipulated. Staying under his control won’t let her see the same manipulation she’s under…and that way she’s never leaving or getting over him. If she lets herself feel like her lover is superior to her, she won’t feel strong enough to move on.\\n\\nDrake sings a similar line on 2011’s “Hate Sleeping Alone”:\\n\\nYou say that you over me\\nYou always end up under me\\n\\nDua is a huge Drake fan, telling Complex she’d “love to work with Drake” and expressing her love of the hip-hop artist on Twitter:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/dualipa/status/758530441427038208\\n\\nShe even covered his 2016 hit single “One Dance” at Capital FM’s Jingle Bell Ball in 2016.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0nuzHz8ps When you’re in the process of getting over someone it’s really easy to fall back into old patterns. This song is meant to be a self-reminder (for anyone who needs it) that just because you’re getting whisked away in the moment doesn’t mean its a good idea in the long term. This is a reminder to not be fooled, it’s pretty hard to be friends with someone you’ve broken up with as the lines can tend to get blurred.',\n",

After all, she can trigger explosions with just a match, so her fiery passion will get her through. Her current situation is causing everybody to worry about her, even causing her to lose friends.\\n\\nWhen she says ‘in too deep’, she may be referring to a toxic relationship or something that is causing the disapproval of others. It also connects to the first verse’s boat metaphor, since she can change this. It doesn’t take a lot to cause a chain reaction. These lines compare insignificant things which result in making a huge difference. All three take a person to do so, like her. This song is her declaration that she’s taking back her life, she’s doing okay, and that she doesn’t need people to believe in her because she’s determined to keep fighting. It’s not her problem if people don’t think she’s strong enough to fight back all the negativity. She knows she is.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis powerful, encouraging chorus gives people confidence to do better, be better, and keep pushing forward regardless of the circumstances. Despite her past, she’s ready to tell the world what she has to say – she wants to be heard, loud and clear.\\n\\nShe spent most of her life holding back the things she wanted to say, thus causing her to have a destructive mindset – as destructive as a wrecking ball slamming into  anything and everything in its way.\\n\\nSounds like she’d have a good time with Miley.',\n",

Tori is thinking about possible realities in which they could have worked out. She’s worrying about the what ifs and make or break moments that could have gone differently. She’s looking back at a old relationship and all the memories of what they used to be. She’s torturing herself with all the things that would have happened if they had stayed together.\\n\\nAnother interpretation is that Tori’s apparent ex-lover was never a lover at all, maybe just a close friend whom Tori always wanted something more with. She knew how totally insane–and brilliant–they were together, but they never took their relationship to the next level. Tori is describing her surroundings, but no matter where she is she cannot stop think about her lover. Tug o' war, a playful game with direct opposition, represents her conflicting emotions.\\n\\nDoes she really want to reunite with her lover? Is it worth all of this internal suffering, or should she keep away? Her mindspace isn’t the most stable. She’s a hot mess in her Sunday best. She thought the high-heels would distract her, but the emotions remain.\\n\\nThey got their own lives – and possibly relationships. But she still cares about her ex.

It’s really rare for me to connect with a song that’s already there but this was the type of song where I really just felt like I wrote it myself.\\n\\nI tracked the song by myself in the studio and really poured my heart into it. That night I got a text with the names of the songwriters and the very first name I saw was my good friend, Zac Poor. He had no idea I was tracking it. It was a surreal moment. I got really emotional because I’ve known Zac for so long and I knew he had been working so hard to get his big break. It was a really cool moment. This is probably my favorite line in the song. I like the visual a lot. It’s another way of stating how fragile you feel and I think it’s very powerful. I think it’s really important to be vulnerable. We live in a world where we want people to view us as really strong and really put together. That’s great, but in reality we’re humans and we’re all going to have those moments where we feel fragile. I think there is a lot of beauty in admitting brokenness. It’s freeing to be able to sing that.\\n\\nMore specifically, this song is really connected to my faith. For me, it’s a love song to God.

You’re beautiful and it’s about time you show the world that and be proud of who you are. The girl is fixated on beauty that’s only skin-deep, so she overlooks her inner beauty and how great of a person she truly is.\\n\\nAlessia wants to reveal this to the girls out there that are going through this, acting as a mirror for them that won’t reflect society’s body-image standards and will show them their true selves. It’s a widely-held stereotype that models, like that of CoverGirl, have eating disorders, either being anorexic, bulimic or eating little-to-nothing at all. This girl wants to be someone that others are jealous of and to have a model’s body. She shrugs off eating a regular diet, rationalizing this with the common phrase that “beauty is pain,” and figuratively fades away to nothing as she loses an unhealthy amount of weight.\\n\\nAgain, magazine covers often advertise beauty as being thin. However, this mindset produces an  unhealthy desire to give up more than you can win back by starving, just to match the girls on the magazine covers that are advertised as beautiful. As she idolizes the media’s perception of beauty, she loses her unique perfection and submits to hunger as a tool to achieve a standard of beauty. And so she fades away. You’re going to get through the struggle of body image issues. It’s hard, but there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. You’re beautiful as you are, but it takes time to be able to see that and accept yourself.\\n\\nYou don’t have to worry about fixing your flaws or changing yourself to fit society’s expectations. Others need to change their views on beauty and accept everyone for who they are. Don’t let their criticism hurt you and leave emotional, or even physical, scars. Everyone shines and is beautiful in their own way, like stars. This girl is so determined to become beautiful by society’s standards, that she doesn’t see the beauty she already has. Society has effectively made her blind to her own beauty because of its reinforcement of these standards.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe tries to internalize her negative emotions and body image issues. Girls that get to be on CoverGirl aren’t upset about how they look; they’ve had surgery or have been photoshopped to fix their flaws. This girl, similar to most people, desires to be pretty. She’s obsessed with looking like a model, being seen as attractive, and fitting society’s rigid beauty standards and will do whatever it takes to achieve this. No one notices what’s happening to her, though, because this type of idolization of “perfect” bodies is so commonplace.\\n\\nCelebrities and models are often described as having “sculpted,” sharp features that could only be made by an artist.

       " 2458848: 'Halsey’s opening line introduces an opposite to Andrew Taggart. She takes the role of the subject in this song, turning it from a monologue to a back-and-forth and delivering a juicy bit of insight, she misses him too. She’s second guessing her choice of leaving him based on looks and not remembering why they broke up because she can’t help but adore him for all the good times.\\n\\nThe last three words might be a subtle nod towards “Gasoline,” a track off of Halsey’s debut album Badlands, where the first lyrics ask:\\n\\nAre you insane like me?\\n\\nShe’s second guessing her choice of leaving him based on looks and not remembering why they broke up because she can’t help but adore him for all the good times. We had been playing “I Miss You” in our sets a lot at the time and Blink was on our minds a lot so that’s where that idea came from. Blink also played a large role in our musical history growing up. As for “Tucson,” it just rhymed and also touches on the geographical special references we use in the song. We just used that setting as the perfect scenario for something like this to happen. Commonly running into people in hotels or destinations unexpectedly, it paints a very vivid image of the pretty girl at the bar with a cocktail and that sort of rush of memories and emotions, mostly physical, leading to a hook up. I think it’s just the acknowledgement of each other’s flaws as people, and the denial of some of them as well. College and growing up at its finest, self-exploration and self-realization. It’s less about drinking to get over and more about the lifestyle that one leads in college and sometimes after as a result. In the case of the song with Halsey, it’s really a dialogue that’s taking place. It could mean a few things: Partially that we are stuck in time repeating a mistake of the past, not learning or growing from it, but it also refers to the light heartedness of this period in our lives. The song is sort of comical in nature, we wanted to make a feel good song about meeting your ex, falling for them on a physical level and them remembering all the horrible truths about why it didn’t work out. So hopefully the lyrics evoke some sort of emotional connection to people but we want people to have fun with it.\\n\\nThe song relates closely to the spoiled girls of college who have family money but also live this dichotomy of the broke college life. For this visually Range Rovers and Boulder communicated that the best.\\n\\nWithout getting too specific we wanted to write a song about something personal to us, but relatable to many. Classically there are lots of hot girls at Syracuse that he would run into and find himself attracted to but forget all the things he hated about them. College for us is mostly where that happened so in this case Cuse. That’s really not relevant but enough to make a song about it. We were listening to Blink-182’s “I Miss You” and had just started playing it in our sets when we wrote this song. A lot of the inspiration for the song writing comes from bands like Blink-182 and Taking Back Sunday. I drink a lot. Most of my relationship issues come from drunk times. This line sums up the sentiment of the reunion. Like the experience made me feel like nothing’s changed. I went to Syracuse University after growing up in Maine and saw all these rich kids from Long Island and New Jersey in their parent’s Mercedes and Range Rovers. Many of my friends from home went off to University of Colorado Boulder and other schools in that area.\\n\\nDifferent lines are pulled from different relationships. The main concept for the girl is a rich girl who lives off her parents allowance and above her means. They’re too lost in the thrill and passion of seeing each other again. Biting is a primal sexual act and the shoulder tattoo gives them a target.\\n\\nA close-up of the album art was posted to Twitter by Halsey; both people in it are heavily tattooed.\\n\\nTattoos are becoming more common, especially in younger age groups. Halsey is a likely inspiration for this line—she has a tattoo of a rose on her shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, Drew has a tattoo on the back of his shoulder which he showed at LollaPalooza Argentina, 2017. Years ago, one of them ended the relationship by moving away and then stopping all communication, as shown in the next line of the song. They moved into the city with a barely working car eager to pursue a new life. This lack of financial stability is particularly reflective of their young age. It also serves as a stark contrast to the girl’s life and current times where she drives expensive Range Rovers.\\n\\nAt the time, the breakup was heartbreaking, but it still hurts them to look back and think about how things ended so badly.\\n\\nInterestingly, Taggart’s pre-chorus claims that Halsey didn’t call him for four years, while Halsey’s claims that Taggart didn’t call her for four years. This shows the tension in their relationship, as they both blame each other for its downfall. This line sums up the sentiment of the reunion. Like the experience made me feel like nothing’s changed.

If he sees her friends, he’ll avoid them as he doesn’t want to risk running into her.\\n\\nPerhaps he also wanted to give the impression that he likes her friends when he really didn’t.

So, no matter what I do, when I look back from 13 to now, it’s about him. It will always be about him. So that’s what it is to me. I do think about a special person. But usually I just think about hitting the notes and doing the dance. It’s not that deep. But there is a special person and that person is why I wrote the song.

I love my drops, so I just blended those two worlds together and it works! Once upon a time, MNEK was known solely for his production and songwriting abilities—he signed his first production deal at age 14. His own musical projects have been less successful, until he and Larsson put out this track.\\n\\nBesides going platinum in Sweden, this song did well in the UK and Australia.

Troye explains his vision for the “Wild” music video:\\n\\nI feel like gay relationships are sexualized in the media and I just wanted to show a romantic, adorable, puppy love situation between two little boys because that’s something we never ever see. Troye is trying to resist the pull of infatuation (trying not to fall) despite his prospective lover’s persistence (trying to wear me down).\\n\\nIn this relationship, Troye is the one being pursued. We see this in the way the lyrics put him in a passive position (it drives me wild, you make my heart shake, I drown in your hands).\\n\\nFurthermore, Troye has stated that this describes the initial rush of flirting with someone and the feeling of exploring something new and exciting. When describing “Wild” he says:\\n\\nIt’s about being a bit tipsy, walking home at night from a club with someone you’ve maybe just met but you’re like, ‘Oh my god! They’re so hot!’\"\\n\\nSo in this case, he could also literally be trying not fall, because he’s tipsy/drunk. It hurts Troye to see their love be condemned, but the forbidden nature of the relationship only heightens his arousal and emotional state.\\n\\nIn the two verses, Troye is wary of how outsiders perceive his relationship, so he keeps it hidden and in the dark. But in the chorus he realizes he’s in love and can’t hide it anymore, so he throws caution to the wind and dares to love wildly and freely.\\n\\nSo, who’s driving Troye wild? Although the song isn’t about one person in particular, Troye said all the songs in this EP “are about boys.” White noise incorporates various sound frequencies, and is often used to drown out other noise. Here it’s used a metaphor for intrusive, persistent thoughts.\\n\\nTroye can’t stop thinking about his lover, to the point of distraction. This line symbolizes overcoming the obstacles in their relationship. Troye pleads with his lover, trying to convince him to escape and leave the sad place they find themselves in. This “place” could very well not be a physical city. but rather about leaving the safe place of not coming out and running wild.\\n\\nWhen explaining the concept of the “Blue Neighbourhood” in an interview with Superfame Troye states:\\n\\nBasically, I come from Perth, which is a moderately sized city of 2 million people. From within that, I come from a really small Jewish community. I feel like I have had this really sheltered, perfect suburban upbringing. And so, all of these stories that I have written come from that place. And take place in that context of this Blue Neighbourhood. It’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s the mundaneness of it, but it’s where your truth is.\\n\\n“Blue Neighbourhood” (a 3-music video series for “Wild,” “Fools,” and “Talk Me Down”) is a story about the difficulties of coming out.\\n\\nYou can see the trilogy here:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xCMF7jsDJI Although drowning isn’t the most comforting metaphor, Troye yearns for his lover’s tight embrace. He wants to lose himself and be smothered in love and ecstasy.\\n\\nLater on the EP, Troye compares falling in love to being a fool. For Troye, even the wait of a few days is too long. Fences and walls both divide, suggesting that they can’t be openly together, since they kiss on barriers, as to in the open.\\n\\nDespite these limitations, they take the time to love each other, while in a position where they can hide their love from the blue neighborhood’s disapproval. It feels substainable, but this wild love will exhaust him.\\n\\nIn these lines, Troye admits that his lover’s attempt to wear him down and get him to stop resisting falling in love is working out – he’s falling for him.',\n",

In terms of evolution, sex is meant for reproduction, but many humans still do it for pleasure instead.\\n\\nShe betrays her cynicism about this fact. Although she wants lots of pleasurable sex, she knows that overdoing it will desensitize her to life. She talks as if people are made of disposable piece—their perfect bodies will eventually age. She’s describing the foreplay, with a mixed level of sensuality. “Lips I kiss” is dictated in a way to remove her lover’s pronouns from the sentence, since she sees him as nothing more than another sex partner whose identity doesn’t matter.\\n\\nOn the other hand (heh), tasting fingertips can be sexy since your lips and fingertips are two of the most sensitive parts on your body. She is so in love with her man that she’ll do anything for him. Actually happens a lot in relationships.\\n\\nThis is ironically reminiscent of “Got Love”. Although this song’s about lust, that song’s about romantic love. Maybe she doesn’t know what love is until she gets it. If you know how to pleasure her, Tove will stay with you for life. Or at least until she gets tired of you. If it’s just sex she’s after, moving in is probably the right move—in most cases, the longer a couple is in relationship, the less sex they have.\\n\\nWhile this lifestyle certainly appeals to her, Tove expresses her mechanical views toward sex through these lines' repetition.\\n\\nAccording to Tove, she originally sang “if you fuck me right, we fuck for life”, but that was deemed too forward. Instead, she suggests progression with the words “love” and “fuck”. She and her man go from the typical loving relationship to fighting like any other couple. The alcohol might have something to do with the aggressive behavior since about three million violent crimes involve offenders that were drinking.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis line holds even greater meaning because it leads into the chorus, specifically the first line and the idea of only being a talking body. The song alludes to the fact that their relationship is held together solely by sex. It’s no secret that Tove loves to drink and day drinking is just another way for her to suppress her emotions. The feeling of his body on her skin is all Tove can think about. She doesn’t even want to leave her bed because that’s likely the last place she felt his touch.\\n\\nThere’s is actually a medical condition for people who have a problem getting out of the bed in the morning called dysania. It’s an actual anixety disorder, so it’s a bit more complex than just feeling lazy on Monday morning. Tove spent all her money on pot because that’s what her significant other likes to do.\\n\\nIn Tove’s native country of Sweden, weed is actually strictly prohibited. It’s actually one of the worst places for weed in the world because they have zero tolerance laws. Cops can also freely question you about drugs so it’s especially risky to smoke in public.\",\n",

This cycle of being weak, cowardly, and sad is caused by the world’s expectations of us. Thus the line,\\n\\nI Feel something so wrong, doing the right thing\\n\\nWhen he actually does something right according to the world, it doesn’t feel right and is left hollow. The phrase “four-letter word” exists because a plurality of profane words in English contain four letters. Being a faith-based song, “hope” is a natural choice for their four-letter word, one of 456,976 possible combinations of four letters. Human skin begins to feel pain from burning at 111 degrees Fahrenheit. Successively higher temperatures cause different degrees of burning, but love has to be at least 111 to register. Most people in the world don’t often like to just do what they are told. They often prefer to be a bit rebellious. He knows that if he is to make the most of life he must dive in and swing on the vine, but is apprehensive to set himself up for disappointment.\\n\\nThe MIT Technology Review explored the physics behind such swinging in Tarzan, which is famous for its vine-swinging sequences. Being unable to lie is a rare trait, indeed. 60% of people lie within ten minutes of a conversation, and most children can recognize the concept by the age of four. As such, this candid admission of adrenaline rush carries greater weight.\\n\\nThe verse’s final line is also a play on Friedrich Nietzsche’s quote, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” This is referring back to the line “I’ve been praying hard,” alluding to the Bible verse “…seek, and ye shall find” from Matthew 7:7. As  lead singer Ryan Tedder thinks that money is being worshipped and loved more than many things in this world, maybe I think it is being suggested that watching money burn would make it feel like taking a dip in holy water (Hindu and Norse ideology) would cleanse oneself of our sins.\\n\\n It’s possible he looks at the way people value money greatly in the world,and by ‘burning money’ they are spending,as to ‘sink in the river the lessons I learn’ most people are taught at a young age to not value money over everything else this being the lesson.\\n\\nMoney is made out of ¾ cotton, which has a burning point of 250℉ (120℃). And  the remaining ¼ is linen. Thus it burns easier than the books with valuable lessons as paper ignites at 480 degrees Fahrenheit, (higher than the 451° Bradbury put on that book title). Green economics once tried to calculate the exact value of earth, and found it to be $195 quadrillion dollars - the figure was taken after figuring out the cost of replacing all of earth’s ecosystems. A Pew Research Center survey found that most people believed old age started at 68. At only 33 when the song was recorded, Tedder has a long way to go before he’s truly old. Money is easier spent than it is made. Actually burning money takes some real heat—it burns at around 765 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nHe also may be describing the feeling of watching “hope” burn when money becomes the primary objective in our lives. When making this song, lead singer Ryan Tedder told Billboard:\\n\\nI felt a responsibility to actually write and sing about things that have a level of human gravity to them. If everybody else sings about sex and love and lust and money, then somebody’s gotta be singing about life and faith and hope and things of that nature.\\n\\nThe folky nature of the guitar-based chorus is inspired by a song he heard while recording with Beyonce.\\n\\nAn astronomer estimated that there are 100 octillion (one followed by twenty-nine zeros) stars in the universe.

Two metaphors are implied from that line\\n\\n\\nSleeping/Slipping near the edge may mean progressing to the end their relationship. In this case they are holding on it (relationship) but they don’t need it anymore. As the succeeding line speaks on the delusion of trying to make it work.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis may also mean holding on to the hurt, wrongs and everything negative that has happened. This you don'’t need especially when you are trying to fix a broken relationship.\\n\\n\\nSleeping at the edge of the bed, depicting not getting along. Therefore in this case they are holding on to a pillow, blanket, Teddy but all it symbolizes is they need to hold each other and the things they are holding they fail to effectively replace the person so the don’t need them. James is trying to make a contrast between the life before and during relationship.\\nYoung single men tend to go out constantly with their friends,getting drunk and trying to find an one night relationship and then he compares it to the beautiful moments at least in the beginning of a relationship,when you constantly want to be together with your other half,go to fancy places well dressed,constructing memories and sleeping with each other.\\nThis part of the relationship left him with good memories despite the end of it. This line and the next is conveying that they are fighting Constant bickering between Bay and his lover has him questioning whether or not the relationship is worth staying in. Over time the foundation of their relationship has dwindled, leaving the two on the brink of calling it quits. “Ashes” refers to the scattered remains of their relationship. Bay insinuates that the relationship was once afire but now has run its course and burned out. Seeing as the spark they once had is no longer there, Bay decides to end it urging his love to do the same. Their broken love has turned to a proverbial dust, to the finest and smallest pieces of what once was a cherished connection, now blown away by a simple breeze. He’s saying that he realizes that it’s delusional, they cant keep this relationship going because it’s too difficult and stressful.\\n\\nThe “delusion” is that he thought the relationship could have carried on strong. However, he states that it would “bring us to our knees” and therefore to save himself from falling he became a realist and saw the fake potential the relationship had, then ended it. James relates holding hands to their relationship, and their hands to themselves as a whole.\\n\\nBecause their hands don’t fit (metaphorically, not literally), their relationship doesn’t work. In the previous line, James said this same line, but in the form of a question. Repeating it for this second time as a statement demonstrates his increasing confidence in his decision to break this relationship off.\\n\\nInstead of asking for her permission, he’s telling her (and reassuring himself) that he is going to be independent. James is evoking the image of separating the chaff from the seed.  https://youtu.be/ds9uKt1M9fI?t=1m10s\\n\\nThe broken part is the illusion of the partnership. He wants them both to be able to find themselves again. He’s suggesting that they should be more true to who the they actually are, rather than what they think makes them work together as a couple. Using the metaphor of a mirror, brings to light the fact the he know acknowledges the problem, not just the little preliminary bumps and miscommunication. Bay expresses his own self-change, not just the relationship as a whole. The edge indicates the end of their relationship. They are about to break up.\\n\\nThe act of “sleeping” near the edge symbolizes helplessness. It’s just a matter of time before they fall.\\n\\nAlso “the edge” may mean literally sleeping on the edge of the bed, away from each other. They’re trying to ignore the problem in front of them. He’s obliquely referencing to the saga of Sisyphus from the Greek mythology, who was damned to roll a stone up a hill which fell back down again every time he was very close to the top of the hill.\",\n",

In the theme of completion in the universe (previously mentioned) a dreamer always has a dream. It takes a “miracle” to save a “lost soul.” The speaker claims that even in the worst person or situation, there is potential for recovery. Even where there is absolute tyranny there is also resistance to the persecution of the innocent or vulnerable – and this reveals the duality of the world. His heart was broken, and he describes the gradual process of how he dealt with it.\\n\\nFirst, he gives up hope. Then, he opens up his heart for another love – he lets himself be exposed and vulnerable. Next, he’s lets himself feel – he becomes consumed with emotions, when he says\\n\\n  \\nI'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday  \\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, in the line about church, he explains that his life has been taken over by his search for higher love. The singer finds beauty in perseverance and will power.

       " 109206: 'Dan doesn’t mean to disappoint anyone but he has a dark side—his inner demons destine him for Hell. He tries making it appear as if everything is under control, but these demons are always there. A masquerade is a social gathering where individuals hide their face under extravagant masks meant to conceal their identity. Under this facade, it becomes very easy to lead others into making their own poor actions in hopes of your demise; at every mistake you make, there are always people who will criticize you. Except the Chorus, these lines are the only repeated phrase in the song, emphasizing its importance on the song as a whole. “Kingdom come” is usually a term used to refer to the end of something, stemming from the Lord’s Prayer in Matthew 6:\\n\\nThy kingdom come, thy will be done,\\nOn Earth as it is in Heaven\\n\\nIn this instance, Dan insists that his disobedience will lead to his own demise. Dan is trying to place the blame for all his wrongdoings on fate. A man can try to cover up his true self, but at the end of the day, his inherency prevails.\\n\\nDan believes this person’s eyes are innocent, and he explains that he does not want to corrupt their purity with his malignant inner demons. Dan has a conflict of interest as he wants to preserve their purity and also wants their help to escape his own immodesty.\\n\\nThese lines appear reminiscent of the bridge from “All Eyes:”\\n\\nNow will the sun come up tonight?\\nBecause your eyes they burn so bright The curtain call marks the end of a theatrical performance where the actors and actresses return to the stage to be recognized by the audience. Once the stage lights fade, the actors and actresses leave behind their deceptive theatrics and return to their normal lives.\\n\\nWhile the curtain call may refer directly to theatrics, it may also allude to life as a whole. The curtain call could be a reference to the Parousia of Christ, where the people who ‘played their part’ ascend to heaven and the evil people of the world remain on Earth.\\n\\nIn the Bible, the Lord punished the serpent to crawl in Genesis 3:14.\\n\\nThen the Lord God said to the serpent, ‘Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all animals, domestic and wild. You will crawl on your belly, groveling in the dust as long as you live.\" When one is very close to another person—if not physically touching—it is not uncommon to feel their body heat. At the same time, the eyes are often seen as the windows to the soul. Dan explains that when someone is close enough, they will be able to see directly into his soul where his inner-demons reside.\\n\\nDan makes sure to warn this person upon looking in his eyes and seeing his inner demons to keep their distance so they don’t become corrupted like Dan makes himself out to be. Though Dan wants to shield others from the harsh realities of the world, Dan finds it impossible to shelter others when he believes the evil is inside of him, too. While these inner beasts/demons may be a direct allusion to his own depression or suicidal thoughts, the lines may also represent one’s own flaws and insecurities. Reality is often more grotesque than what others want you to see. The pessimistic view this as necessary because the truth often hurts in the short term. Because of this, the truth is hidden as a way to shelter individuals from the harsh realities of the world. However, this may cause problems in the long term where deceit builds and causes more harm than good.\\n\\nThese lines likely foreshadow “Dream” where the narrator expresses their disillusionment to the truth:\\n\\nIt’s not what you painted in my head\\nThere’s so much there instead of all the colors that I saw Dan is referring to his difficulties in trying to make his dreams come into fruition. His failed ambitions were only catalyzed by the friends who failed and gave up on him. After this experience, Dan was let down by those surrounding him, unnerved by the ones he held in such high regard.\\n\\nWhen blood becomes stale, this means that the blood has become oxygenated due to the stopping of one’s heartbeat. The feeling of his dreams dashed and ambition ruined is further accentuated by these lines as one’s heartbeat acts as a metaphor for ambition and passion. In poker, to fold your cards is to concede that round and end your turn. This is common when dealt a bad hand or under the impression that your opponent has better cards than you do.\\n\\nMetaphorically, everyone has their own share of dreary days where things don’t work out and life bogs you down—similar to being dealt a bad hand. Avarice transcends color, creed, sexual orientation and affiliation. Dan believes that most things in life is done for a specific reason, driven by our greed and selfishness. In “Gold” the band similarly talked about the downsides of fame and how greed will corrupt one’s life:\\n\\nFirst comes a blessing of all that you’ve dreamed\\nBut then comes the curses of diamonds and rings\\nOnly at first did it have its appeal\\nBut now you can’t tell the false from the real This can refer to the worshiping of false or “golden” idols, instead of God. This may be idolatry—an excessive worshiping of something secular and treating it as a god. Idolatry may be in awe of the wealthy and their superficiality.\\n\\nPictures of Saints in the Catholic church are usually decorated with golden halos or other gilded iconography. Dan Reynolds is implying that there is a current lack of good—or “saintly”—people, and the only saints left are the ones in pictures or golden statues.',\n",

Someday, you can end up renowned like the people with their names in Hollywood’s Hall of Fame, as long as you keep trying to achieve what you want. Someday, you can be a household name – and be eligible for Level 3 Verification on Genius – and you’ll look back and think, “I can’t believe I used to believe that I don’t have the power to inspire the world like this.” Someday, things like this can happen, and all you need in order to make it happen is to believe that it CAN and WILL happen, and persevere. (This should be a message to the whole world, since all the words are in plural form.)\\n\\nBe students – learn from other people\\nBe teachers – don’t just learn, teach too. You have to be able to do both in life.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe politicians – lead others towards a more promising future, using the power you gain by learning and teaching\\nBe preachers – believe in yourself and others and tell the truth. Be authentic.\\n\\nThere is also another possible perspective you could take – these are all just suggestions for what you could be if you take the chance and persevere. Meaning to say, there are millions of things out there that YOU could be. So be them. You can be strong.\\n\\nThis line is an allusion to King Kong from the movie, in the scene where he bangs on his chest on top of the Empire State building. This symbolifies strength, courage, and pride of achievement – come on, it feels like the top of the world up there. The fact that he’s on top represents success (climbing to the top), how he’s not at all scared to fall represents courage, and the chest-banging is obviously strength.\\n\\nTo reach the “top” (which in your case is your personal goal, not the top of the Empire State), you have to have those traits. And they’re saying here that you CAN have those traits, meaning you CAN reach the top. This could be taken both literally and figuratively.\\n\\nLiteral: Breaking all the records that people said were impossbile to break. This comes as a surprise in sports a lot, for example, when the number of one player scoring 86 goals within a calendar year seems so overwhelming and everybody thinks it’s never going to be broken, and then some other player comes up with 91. Records are not impossible to break. Nothing is impossible, as long as you commit yourself to it.\\n\\nFigurative: Proving people wrong. You don’t have to conform to the popular opinion all the time, you don’t have to agree with others all the time. In fact, you shouldn’t do that. And because sometimes the popular choice is the choice against you succeeding (“me against the world” moments), you should just go out there, give ‘em all you’ve got, and leave 'em all in awe after seeing that you’re not what they expected after all. Take your shot and prove your haters wrong.

It doesn’t matter what you want to be, but if you want to be it, just go for it and be it. Whether the dream is being a teacher, politician, preacher, leader, champion, astronaut or anything else. But you have to believe. Believe you can be it, and may have to become a student to learn how to be it, but you will be it eventually. If you dedicate yourself to something, you could one day represent your country and make it proud. You can’t only think of what you want, you also have to think about who you are. Your name and your country are part of the definition of Y-O-U. Do it not only for yourself, but for what you represent, for what represents you, for what you are part of, for what is part of you. You can do the toughest things with ease if wish to and apply yourself. Even hell can’t be a problem for you if you do that. Seek for your true purpose in life.\\n\\nYour purpose can be whatever you find enjoyable and “worth the pain” to do; it dosen’t have to be something fancy.\\n\\nSearch for the truth beneath all the lies, because not everything is what it seems. And when you do find the truth, you can work for the hall of fame from there. Just try it. Most people never develop their biggest talent because they don’t try. Do whatever you are doing for the people that got you there. Do it so you can always be proud of yourself and others can be too. You’ll never know what things are like if you never actually try them. You’ve got nothing to lose. You can beat the clock – you can live by your own schedule and not have anyone controlling you. Beating the clock also suggests time: Living longer. If you were enough dedicated into living a longer life, your human passion and dedication will make you go and do all sorts of stuff to make that happen. All because you CAN DO IT.\\n\\nYou can move a mountain – nobody literally goes and moves mountains, but this is just a suggestion that you can do anything as long as you believe and persevere. In fact, with the present-day technology, someone probably could, quite literally, move a mountain. Nothing’s impossible, as long as you believe that you CAN DO IT.\\n\\nYou can break the rocks – you can break free of whatever’s restraining you, just because you CAN DO IT.\\n\\nIf you apply yourself, you can be the master of everything.\\n\\nIt’s never too late to do anything as long as you are willing to do it, even if it was as hard as moving mountains and breaking rocks, because on the inside, you are THAT strong! Just believe in yourself.. Be the one to give a good example to others, be the perfect idol, teach others who don’t understand ways to make the world a better place. Be what a good leader would be, but teach the others to become leaders of themselves as well. Anything is possible when you put your mind to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you believe in the strength of your actions and you have the right motivation and willpower, you can achieve anything. You can also beat the worst things in life that seem unbeatable, like war. You just have to believe you can! The first two lines give the listener a good idea of what this entire song’s about.\\n\\nYou can be the best as long as you try and use your abilities to the fullest and believe in yourself. If you work, you can be the best at anything you want to be. There isn’t one person considered a G.O.A.T. who doesn’t dedicate themselves to what they’re doing, so do that, and you can become one of those GOATs. Dedication, passion, and faith is all you need. Work hard to achieve your goals and you could end up, well, in the hall of fame.

He wants to “let it be”, and that is his way of telling himself to let it go, move on. HE is reminded, however, that it might take a while for him to get over this person, and he doesn’t know if he can. This is alluding to the fact that he is uncertain, doubting that this person wants to be with him even though he loves them very much. Since this is just the first verse, it it just the trickling of doubt. Daniel is implying that the girl has been giving him less attention than what he wanted and seems to be acting so distant from him. Here, Daniel is saying that she is starting to forget who he is. This could be referring to one of two things:\\n\\n\\nWith this person, he has found a soulmate, and a “homie” in one. Because he has this person now, he feels as though he doesn’t need friends, or in contrasting thought, he feels as though this person is like a friend to him (will stick with him through thick and thin).\\nHe has a best friend, a “homie” who he already considers a soulmate, in a non-romantic manner. He already has this soulmate in his life, and didn’t think he’d find someone who means more to him/understands him, more than his friend. “Bending it over” could be a sexual reference, but I think, in this particular instance, it is referring more to the subject of being taken advantage of. He would let this person do anything to him; likewise, he would do anything for them.\\n\\nHe views this person as his “four leaf clover”. which is associates with immense luck.

       " 457424: \"This song is full of ambiguity, which is part of the reason it is so appealing. The narrator could either be referencing ‘the way’ Alison is feeling: sad, rejected by her husband/lover, or just as likely, just simply not loving the narrator himself, as she once used to. The song is interesting In its sad twist which sees the way in which the narrator transposes his own self loathing into the object of his affection, either way. This line, and it’s repetition could have various meanings, depending on the listener’s interpretation of the rest of the song. The first, and most obvious example is that the narrator is contemplating killing ‘Alison’ him self ( referenced in lines such as “I think somebody better put out the big light”). The second, could be a desperate state of machismo,the narrator attempting to convince ‘Alison’ (and himself) that he is all that, as good as their ‘little friend, and more. The third option (and probably the most probable, given the line’s ambiguity) is that all the narrator want to tell the girl that his aim ( eg: his intentions) are still 'true’ (think honourable) and that he is just trying to show that he still cares about her, despite all of what has happened. Costello has divulged little on the meaning of the song other than to say that it is about “disappointing somebody” and to deny suggestions that the lines “somebody better put out the big light” and “my aim is true” refer to murder. He has also declined to reveal who the song is about, writing in the liner notes for Girls Girls Girls, “Much could be undone by saying more.” This is a play on words.\\n\\nCostello doesn’t know whether or not she’s in love with someone or been having sex with somebody. The only thing he’s certain of his that she haven’t been having sex with his body. Note Costello’s caustic tone.\\n\\n“Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake?” implies that the moment they were married, he changed. He abandoned or stopped caring for her.\\n\\n“You used to hold him right in your hand” implies that she used to have him wrapped around her finger – he would do anything for her. But now, that’s changed.\\n\\nAccording to Matt LeMay in Pitchfork:\\n\\nPunks didn’t give a fuck; Elvis was sensitive enough to not only give a fuck, but smart enough to be pissed off and disturbed by that fuck.

       " 94383: 'Probably supports the idea of global warming while playing off of the previously mentioned idea of Beatles as in their song “Here Comes The Sun.” At the time of writing this, the growth of the Cold War was prevalent leading to Thatcher the PM at the time, developing the nuclear deterrent for Britain with historical cornerstones like storing Cruise Missiles at Greenham Common.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Clash are stating that they anticipate the coming Cold War which was widely thought as Television Series like “Threads” were introduced later.They then further to state of the societal effects due to the fear of war looming like the crop being poor and Britain becoming a dystopia.\\n\\nThe Clash’s music was often charged with left-wing ideological sentiments which leads to them disagreeing with the fact of nuclear warfare. Strummer, in particular, was a committed socialist.\\n\\nThe Clash are credited with pioneering the advocacy of radical politics in punk rock, and were dubbed the “Thinking Man’s Yobs” by NME, like many early punk bands, the Clash protested against monarchy and aristocracy. A reference that despite most of the song criticizing media hysteria, exaggeration and scaremongering of issues there was usually some grain of truth in most of the stories that genuinely needed addressing. Just like The Beatles inspired a “Beatlemania” with  troves of hysterical fans, many British bands tried to imitate the Fab Four and created an homogenous musical scene that annoyed Mick Jones:\\n\\nThe line about phony Beatlemania biting the dust was aimed at all the touristy sound-alike rock bands in London in the late ‘70s. We were fans of The Beatles, The Who and The Kinks—but we wanted to remake all of that. We wanted “London Calling” to reclaim the raw, natural culture. We looked back to earlier rock music with great pleasure, but many of the issues people were facing were new and frightening. Our message was more urgent—that things were going to pieces.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe line can also be interpreted as a dig on both the fans that rode the punk rock boom as if it was a craze, and another instance of British music being watered-down, the musical Beatlemania (“Not the Beatles, but an incredible simulation!”). The infamous energy crisis of the 1970s began in 1973 when OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) declared an oil embargo in protest of American support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War.  In Britain, it coincided with a coal miners strike, furthering the crisis.  Things became so bad that Edward Heath’s government was forced to shorten the work week to three days and restrict electrical usage in 1974.  The embargo ended in 1974, but was followed by a panic in 1979 (the year London Calling was recorded) when oil output decreased slightly due to the Iranian Revolution. After a number of years with abnormal weather in the early 1970s, wheat crops in much of the world failed.  This led to a shortage of wheat on the global market and a dramatic increase in the price of food.  Wheat in the United States fared far better than the rest of the world, but this was of little consolation to Great Britain, which was running a massive trade imbalance by the 1970s. This seems paradoxical to the previous line about the ice age beginning, but it is likely referring to the economic meltdown of much of the Western world during the 1970s.  The post-war economic boom of the late 1940s continued until the late 1960s, when long-festering economic problems came to a head.  The recession of the 1970s was particularly painful in that it produced stagflation, where high unemployment coincides with high inflation.  These economic hardships played an integral role in the formation of punk’s “no future”/ nihilist message. During the 1970s, largely unsupported theories about global cooling received widespread media attention.  The theory posited that the slight downward trend of mean temperatures from the 1940s to the early 1970s was a sign of the start of a global freeze which would culminate in massive glaciation – a sort-of second ice age.  This phenomenon was ultimately more about media hysteria than actual scientific study.\\n\\nAt the same time, the scientific community was becoming deeply concerned by the threat of global warming. This line refers to the infamous Three Mile Island accident, which occurred in 1979 shortly before London Calling was written.\\n\\nThe incident essentially consisted of a series of mechanical issues in a nuclear power plant which caused the leakage of large amounts of nuclear coolant.  This caused unknown amounts of radioactive chemicals to be released into the surrounding environment.\\n\\nThe Three Mile Island accident remains the most significant accident in the history of U.S. commercial nuclear power plants, cleanup cost 1 billion dollars, and Americans were more fearful than ever of nuclear technology in its aftermath.\\n\\nThough the lyric suggests an indifference to these events, Joe Strummer himself has described his feelings at the time:\\n\\n“We felt that we were struggling about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there was no one there to help us.” Strummer wants people to pay attention to the issues that are facing them without being aggressive and confrontational about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut despite his best intentions, he feels that level of aggression may be necessary because his audience doesn’t care enough to even stay awake with his current means of addressing them.\\n\\nAdditionally, “nodding out” also refers to passing out from drugs (commonly heroin), meaning he is also talking about the apathy that is caused by hard drug use. Like many of the tracks on London Calling — including “The Card Cheat”, “Revolution Rock”, and “Jimmy Jazz” — the song doesn’t end by resolving strongly to the tonic or fading out, as most rock and roll songs do. Instead, it breaks down eerily, with Joe Strummer’s cryptic last words “I never felt so much a-like…” echoing over Morse code feedback (the characters spelling out S-O-S).\\n\\n\\n\\nIn live versions of the song, Strummer sang a complete version of the final line, which is “I never felt so much a-like singing the blues”.  This is a direct quote from the first line of Melvin Endsley’s “Singing The Blues” (1956), a popular song from the 50’s recorded by Guy Mitchell.  It sets up the next track, “Brand New Cadillac,” a cover of a 1950’s rock and roll song. Strummer and Jones criticize casual drug taking\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sclera (the white part of the eye) turns yellow in the setting of jaundice as a result of hepatitis, a disease commonly seen in iv drug abuse. The 1960s are often referred to as “The Swinging Sixties” because that decade saw the destruction or reduction of many of the social norms associated with Victorian Morality.  “Swinging” is slang for being lively, exciting, fashionable, and sexually promiscuous.  In 1965, Time magazine christened London “The Swinging City.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Truncheon” is one of the numerous names for a police baton.   Thus, Strummer is saying that, by the late ‘70s, the only swinging in the “Swinging City” was coming from the batons of policemen brutalizing the populous.  1970s London (and England in general) was plagued by numerous riots, most of which involved political extremists.  The most explosive of these was the so-called “Battle of Lewisham,” which occurred in 1977, two years prior to the release of “London Calling.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Clash also criticize the police in their song I Fought the Law This comes from concerns that if the River Thames flooded, most of central London would drown, something that led to the construction of the Thames Barrier.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, the lyric is a metaphor for London’s economic struggles and class inequalities. If the river was represented as the lowest part of the totem pole in London’s class system, and Strummer lives by the river, then he’d be the first to drown.\\n\\nThis is some gallows humor from Strummer. Throughout the chorus, he mentions all the troubles facing the world, but he won’t have to deal with all of that because he’ll be dead by then anyway. It should be noted that at the time he wrote this song, he literally did live by the river — in an apartment next to the River Thames. These lyrics reflect the desperate situation of the band in 1979.   The Clash was struggling with high debt, without management, and arguing with their record label over whether the London Calling album should be a single or double album.\\n\\nNow don’t look to us\"\\n\\n…reflects the concerns of the band over its situation after the punk rock boom in England in 1977 had ended.  The Clash had been one of the bands at the forefront of the punk movement, rivaled only by The Sex Pistols.  Here, they tell their listeners that they don’t have any solution to the demise of punk.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhony Beatlemania has bitten the dust\"\\n\\nPunk groups despised much of the pop music of the 1960s, but even more of their vitriol was directed at the progressive rock of the late 60s and early 70s.  The Beatles, with their massive pop appeal and their later move towards progressive music with Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and subsequent albums, were emblematic of much of what punks hated.  [Beatlemania] was a term that originated during the 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy surrounding The Beatles.  The Beatles had broken up in 1970, so Beatlemania, one of the things most associated with 1960s England, had indisputably “bitten the dust” by 1979. “This is London calling…”\\n\\nWas used by the BBC World Service station to identify themselves in broadcasting to occupied countries during World War II.  The BBC program “London Calling” remained in existence until 1993.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this case they’re announcing the start of another war.',\n",

It was used especially when said person would spit while pronouncing ’s’ sounds, or could simply be used in place of a separate comeback. This line references the song “We Will Fall” from The Stooges‘ debut album.  The beginning of this Sonic Youth theme has a similar atmosphere to this specific Stooges song.\\n\\nSY had already covered a track from The Stooges' first album. This could be a reference to the famous quote “Everybody talks about the weather…WE DON’T” which was printed on a poster by German socialists students at the height of the 60’s youth movement.  The whole song deals with youth rebellion and this was a powerful phrase used by radicals, something the band would have grown up with and been influenced by. Every one has got through that existencial phase in which you need a powerful purpose in life to get out of bed. To make everyday meaningful. That’s why every important revolution in the world needs young blood. Active. Energic. Dreamful.\\n\\nLook for example May 68 in France: “You’re it” is delivered in a sarcastic tone in order to poke fun at people who rate music or art, who think that the trendiest things are the most essential ones.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt also sounds like a game of tag, in which the pursuer is labelled as “it.” This song was originally called “J.

Humanity is repeating the same mistakes over and over, and as this keeps going on things will get worse and worse.\\n\\n\\n\\nSociety is viewing the world from it’s television screens and if anything, it’s in regression as it becomes more and more afraid to deal with the problems it sees.

Individuals in modern society are completely oblivious to the true world outside their personal bubble of concern.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis continues because everyone is only self-concerned and the media is supporting conformity. The subject of the lyrics of this song concerns the people in the world that just blindly follow whatever the mainstream media tells them, and because of it, the world makes no social progress, only regression.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has a bit of a 1984 feel to it, especially the last verse.\",\n",
       " 98693: \"Westerberg sings Mickey Louse instead of Mickey Mouse here. One has to wonder in this alternate history Mickey Louse and not Mouse is popular and this reference has to do with the nostalgic “what if?” premise of this song in which Alex Chilton and Big Star had Beatles-esque pop saturation. The lyrics could also just be mocking the Disneyfication of America in the 1980s. These words can also be heard as “Attendin' a riot (on campus)”.\\n\\nChilton was 18 in March 1968 and still had a residence in Memphis when the riots erupted, “on campus”, with an estimated 22,000 Memphis students skipping school for the protest led by MLK.\\n\\nThe relevance here is that the Box Tops were described as a white group that “sounded black”.\\n\\nSo with Alex Chilton, the man, as a metaphor, Westerberg explores identity, fame, fortune, and misfortune. According to Bob Mehr’s Trouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements, this line was inspired by Westerberg’s first meeting with Chilton. Paul wanted to tell Alex how much he loved “Watch the Sunrise” off of Big Star’s #1 Record, but could not remember the name of the song. Alex Chilton was very into astrology, which may have served as the starting point of the song (as well as the subsequent reference to tarot cards).\\n\\nHe also published some music under the ASCAP name “Venus Hound Music” starting in 1986 (the year recording began on Pleased to Meet Me).\\n\\nThese two planets/symbols are also ancient archetypes for pacification/feminine (Venus) and aggression/masculine (Mars). They trace back to Roman myth. So, “feed us with a spoon” means  spoon-feeding pop music to the masses (i.e., pacification) but “Mars” would embody the rambunctious and supposedly “masculine” spirit of rock. “Good Luck Charm” is a rare Kinks bootleg and “Face to Face” is one of their classic albums. This seems to be describing something that really happened between Paul and Alex. Alex Chilton was born in 1950 in Memphis, Tennesseee.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis band, Big Star, was based in Memphis, and he lived there on and off throughout his life.\\n\\nThe Replacements recorded Pleased to Meet Me at the Ardent Studios in Memphis, the same place where Big Star recorded all of their albums. Alex Chilton was the lead singer and one of the song writers for Big Star in Memphis in the early 1970s. Though Big Star is largely regarded as one of the most influential power-pop bands of all time, they were commercially unsuccessful. Alex Chilton was one of Paul’s favorite artists and the lead singer of Big Star.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis line is a bit tongue-in-cheek because children by the million never sang for Alex Chilton… Big Star didn’t get the respect they deserved til toward the end of the members' lifetimes. It’s possible that this line is “Falling asleep with a Box Top video on.” While other people have claimed that, mostly because it would kind of fit and would make a lot more sense–Alex Chilton was a member of the Box Tops, a Memphis rock group from the 60s who had a hit with “The Letter”–it’s pretty hard to argue that he says anything other than “flop top video” here. The Replacements' lyrics have never strained too hard to be coherent, and this seems more ephemeral and referential than concerete. “Flop Pop” evokes floppy haired kids singing songs about girls and surfboards and prom, which fits the over all theme of this song: “I’m in love. What’s that song?” There’s not much else to say about this line, other than that’s some of the purest summing up of what it’s like to listen to the radio and just fall in love with something random and pure and wonderful.\\n\\nIt could also be referencing lyrics in Big Star’s song “I’m in Love with a Girl”. Alex Chilton was born and grew up in Memphis, and lived a significant portion of his life there. Big Star was formed there. He frequently moved to New York City, always moving back or at least visiting Memphis to record there.\\n\\nHe eventually moved to New Orleans, where he died of a heart attack on St. Patrick’s Day, 2010. It was not cool, babe.\\n\\nThe line may be a reference to Elvis Presley, who actually did die in Memphis. By suggesting that Chilton should die there, too, the narrator is purposefully putting them on the same level, which is high praise, considering Presley’s vast cultural influence. St. Mark’s Place, a four block stretch in the East Village of Manhattan, is one of the centers of the music universe. It’s also been, at various times, a teaming cesspool of punks, protopunks, beggars, drug addicts, and tourists.\\n\\n\\n\\nChilton lived in New York in the late 1970s.\\n\\nThis line describes how Paul Westerberg and Alex Chilton first met. What better description of how it feels to listen to someone singing over the radio or via a record and somehow, without ever meeting you, sum up what’s going on in your life?\",\n",
       " 388422: 'Rather morbid first lines contrasting the upbeat music.  This could be a realisation time is passing on (therefore getting old) and the narrator feels as though love may be the only thing getting them through this life. Also feeling deeply unhappy at the idea of getting old conveys a fear of time passing and a particular fondness of youth. Suggests such a deep bond and love that the narrator fears losing their love as much as a child fears losing their mother. Whether the narrator initially dismissed their love out of spite or out of love and respect for their wishes, they’re now backtracking and realising that they truly can’t do without their love. This could be a sort of angry dismissal- as if the narrator is so upset with their love wanting to end the relationship that they tell them to leave out of spite.\\n\\nCould also be seen as a “if you love someone, let them go” type sentiment.',\n",
       " 213958: 'Keep your wits about you, keep a thick skin so you can be resilient to crisis, and hang in there.\\n\\nAs Prince tells us in the last line, there are real dangers in life. Pills, whether they’re prescriptions or street drugs in pill form, can kill you. Thrill-seeking, like drug abuse or daredevil behavior, is often risky and can kill you too. Daffodils look beautiful, but – as your mother may have warned you – eating enough of them would kill you as well!\\n\\nTake the danger seriously and be tough so you can survive. “Dr Everything’ll-Be-Alright” wants you to turn off your awareness of death, risk, and suffering so you can feel relaxed all the time. Prince doesn’t want you to do that. If you ignore the risks of eating daffodils or doing drugs, you could die early.\\n\\nPrince told us that we live in a “hard” world, and to be self-reliant because “you’re on your own”. Everything won’t necessarily be alright in this life. We should celebrate life because we get to experience it – not because of a delusion that life isn’t difficult. In an exhaustively researched piece on Purple Rain’s title track, Anil Dash notes that in 1984 Prince was actively trying to bridge his white and black fanbases; Prince’s solution for doing this was to add a healthy dollop of conventional, top-40 rock to his funk.\\n\\nHe came to this realization after a disastrous opening gig for The Rolling Stones wherein he was literally booed off the stage. Prince took note that the other opening band, the J. Geils Band, was not booed off the stage and had the audience’s complete attention.\\n\\nDash writes:\\n\\nLittle wonder then that “Let’s Go Crazy,” written just a year later, would incorporate the same staccato organ stabs and driving beat as [the J. Geils monster hit] “Freeze Frame” (heard quite clearly in the full-length version of “Let’s Go Crazy”), substituting Prince’s trademark Linn drums for the more conventional sounds of the Geils song, and replacing the “freeze frame!” shout with a similarly percussive “oh no, let’s go!” refrain. This is most likely a reference to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ when Jesus will return back to Earth to claim all of the Christians back up to Heaven. So, we are told that no eye has seen nor ear has heard when the Lord will return, so until then, live life for all it’s worth.\\n\\n1 Corinthians 2:9 (KJV):\\n\\nBut as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. A line very reminiscent of another of his hits “1999”, Prince encourages us to live for the moment because we never know what’ll happen tomorrow.\\n\\nThe Grim Reaper is a popular personification of death. Legend has it the reaper himself will generally knock on your door if it’s your time to go.\\n\\n\\n\\nR.I.P. Prince – June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016 Prince reminds us to evaluate the world around us in a more positive light. We all have things we wish we could change or things that generally bring us down, but hey, at least we have friends!\\n\\nThis song is trying to get us to break from the down, depressed state we find ourselves in by “going crazy” and fixing our own situations even if the means are a bit, well, drastic. In reference to the prior verse, Prince is saying that the reason you should worry about losing your mind is that life isn’t fair or easy. Prince is saying that you should be more worried about losing your mind than you should be about mortality. ‘The preacher’ admits he doesn’t have a reason they should ‘go crazy’, other than the fact that one day they’re gonna die. Sound familiar? Prince wants his listeners to ‘go crazy’, presumably like monkeys, and look for the ‘purple banana’. “Let’s Go Crazy” is the opening track to Purple Rain, and Purple, perceived as the most holiest of colors, is all Prince wishes for. Don’t let the devil take you ‘down’. This line refers to the assumption that hell is located in the underworld, and ‘punching a higher floor’ would save them, and bring them to heaven (the top floor, obviously). The sermon continues with our Purple Preacher telling his audience that even though ‘life’ is a scary concept, there’s still the afterworld to look forward to.\\n\\nA recurring motif in Prince’s music was calm (even joy) in the face of death/the end times.  (See also: “1999.”  “Purple Rain,”  “7,” “The Most Beautiful Girl In the World,” etc.)\\nIn his book I Would Die 4 U: How Prince Became an Icon, journalist/critic Touré explores how Prince’s religious upbringing in the Seventh-day Adventist Church informed both his worldview and art. He writes:\\n\\n[A] lifelong Adventist tells told me, “Growing up, Prince would’ve heard the world is going to end any day now and you had to keep constant watch.” This perhaps explains why Prince’s music is so often concerned with the apocalypse and the Second Coming…. Prince sees others running from the apocalypse because they don’t know better, or because they fear death, but Prince doesn’t run, and isn’t afraid because he knows what’s happening and he welcomes the end of days. He knows death is a portal to heaven. These moans indicate another male companion is present. De-elevator is a metaphor for the Devil, hinting at the spiritual subtext of “Let’s Go Crazy.” Renaming or coding the Devil in various guises is a move that Prince returned to repeatedly in his work; for instance, the Devil appeared as “Spooky Electric” during the Lovesexy era (cf. “I No”) and as Gemini/The Joker during the Batman era (cf. “Dance With the Devil,” “Electric Chair”).\\n\\nIn an eerie (and grimly poetic) bit of life imitating art, Prince was found dead in an elevator at his Paisley Park recording compound. Traditional funeral ceremonies often begin with these very same words, instilling a sense of comfort and community in the audience. Much in the same way, Prince is addressing his listeners not as separate from the message conveyed in this song, but as a part of it; no one is exempt from life, it’s trials, and it’s end.\\n\\nThis same sentiment is carried throughout the song through the use of an organ in the instrumental and various allusions to religion or spirituality. He’s referring to heaven, or the related concept of Paradise.\\n\\nWhen he wrote “Let’s Go Crazy,” Prince was a lapsed Christian.  Prince would later, in the 2000s, become a Jehovah’s Witness –\\xa0they believe that only 144,000 “anointed ones” will get to chill in heaven with god, and the other good Jehovah’s Witnesses will inherit the earth as a Paradise, which is sort of like a lesser, slightly more plausible alternative to heaven. Purple is the color you associate with Prince, and to go bananas is a synonym of “to go crazy, get nuts”.\\n\\n\\n\\nPurple bananas DO exist (you can only get yellow at the store because the non-yellow ones spoil too easily), but that’s not what Prince has in mind.\\n“Purple banana” is just a way to express the will to escape from the dull regular life by… well, for example by getting wild at dancing to this ‘til it’s all over (“try to enjoy your life and don’t let other people get you down, for how can you know when the grim reaper will knock at your door”, he says later). The pills Dr. Everything’ll Be Alright gives are not the real solution; the thrills, or living without rules or purpose; and daffodils – beautiful, yet poisonous flowers which can metaphorically apply to people – are all deadly to not only living a healthy life, but a spiritually detrimental.\\n\\nPrince believes these drugs or pills may make a person numb and unable to maintain an emotional balance. One of “Let’s Go Crazy”’s motifs is that a little madness is not just OK, but a thing to be proud of.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fact he’s chosen the daffodil (see above) among all other flowers is not casual. Apart from the repetition of sound, it references the famous poem by William Wordsworth, in which the daffodils stand for the outstanding, wonderful treat that nature can suddenly enrich you with. We can say that the “purple rain” is Prince’s daffodils Also, daffodils are poisonous!They look beautiful, but eating enough of them would kill you.\\n\\n“Thrills” allude to any behavior that, while exciting, is high risk (drug or alcohol addiction, etc.) can kill you too of course.\\n\\nSo as you enjoy the beautiful world around you, you have to be cautious and use common sense, so you can continue to be here.  “Let’s Go Crazy” isn’t just about enjoying life – it’s about survival, and celebrating survival. Prince told us earlier that we live in a “hard” world, and to be self-reliant because “you’re on your own”.  That means protecting yourself from danger, and not doing stupid things like eating daffodils.\\n\\n“Dr Everything’ll-Be-Alright” wants you to turn off your awareness of death, risk, and suffering so you can feel relaxed all the time. Prince doesn’t want you to do that. Everything won’t necessarily be alright, in this life! There are lots of things that can go wrong. So Prince wants you to “hang tough”. Keep your wits about you, keep a thick skin so you can be resilient to crisis, and hang in there.\\n\\nAnd if being aware of reality drives you nuts? Enjoy it. If the price of sanity is blinding yourself to reality, Prince doesn’t want it.',\n",

The singer laments how in modern society people can only express their emotions by imparting hard-earned cash for consumer goods. Perhaps the author of the book in question articulates emotion that the singer’s partner struggles to articulate for themselves. If the song is about the “modern love” of the 21st Century, here the narrator is blaming the relationship for not having real conversations as they are not discerning and/or demanding. This line uses the classical metaphor of the subconscious. See Dante’s Inferno.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Inferno All the narrator wants is for the boy to come out with it and demand he be with him, because he’d be happy to oblige. However, this modern love means people are scared to express their true feelings. The narrator may seem bored with the other person when they talk, as he doesn’t appear to get involved in their conversation very much. However, this is only because he is tongue-tied by his feelings.\\n\\nIt seems like he’s lost in his mind, but he really does enjoy being with them, and doesn’t want his aloofness to be interpreted as disinterest. The person is holding back and seems uncommitting. They have problems that keep stopping them from getting together and it’s making the narrator frustrated. The narrator finally finds the blunt words he’s expressed a desire to say throughout the whole song and asks them to come round and be with him.',\n",

This is a sad but insightful line, where the narrator understands that the optimism and energy of youth that generates these new ideas may actually not work, but at least they tried – it’s better than just giving in. This is a reference to the police, whose authority goes unchecked. He is rejecting the notions of the older generation who have pre-judged them, perhaps solely on the basis of how they dress and act, rather than what they have to say. He’s suggesting the old can learn from the young. He wants to engage the older generation with his new ideas but those ideas frighten them. This is the voice of the angry young man, in this particular case punk rock and youth culture speaking truth to power. The “you” to which he refers is the patriarchal society in which the older generation think they can tell him what to do and how to live.',\n",

She’s so far disconnected from everyone, being “Alaska” that she could easily tell a lie and no one would be the wiser.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it could be continuing the analogy that Stephanie is Alaska. This could mean that when it says countries it’s referring to men or just people in general. She’s still making seem as if there’s more going on in her life, but less literally than the first interpretation. She’s disassociated from the world and is feeling cold and despondent. To the outside world, she seems cold… hence the Alaska reference Reference to this first verse. Sea is used instead of “country” making a point of the perceived dichotomy between land and sea. In this line, the narrator says that Stephanie’s thoughts of how people treat her might not be real. She is overreacting or thinks people hate her, even though they don’t She’s kind of in limbo – she’s part of the world, but she isn’t actually PART of it. She is unable to get really close with people. People meet her and are friends with her but eventually they move on. People wonder about Stephanie if she likes living alone and isolated. Her answer is no, it’s a cold and lonely existence. This song is about a girl who feels like she’s wasted her life, maybe she’s had her heart broken a few times, or been too close to people who let her down. She’s sort of a doormat, she’s used and feels like she isn’t liked by her “friends,” even when she “given half her life” for them. Stephanie feels like she’s given up, she openly accepts death because of all the hurt and rejection she has received. The people all call her Alaska because they think of her as cold-hearted, as she has isolated herself from her “friends” and “the people she hates now.”\\n\\nFun Fact: the titular character in John Green’s book Looking For Alaska was actually named after this line.',\n",
       " 352796: 'Deal explained the song in an interview:\\nhttps://youtu.be/ZbmiIeImwJI\\n\\nIt’s about … watching a young kid and an old woman, an older married woman get together. Have sex. Sex between a black man and a white woman. In the 50s, when it was, like, taboo to do that.\\n\\nThis is why they have to go to a “shady place”.\\n\\nIncidentally (perhaps just a coincidece), a relationship between an older woman and a younger man was the subject of Douglas Sirk’s 1955 movie “All That Heaven Allows”, which was remade by R. W. Fassbinder in 1974 as “ Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” (except the relationship is between a white woman and an arab man) and by Todd Haynes in 2002 as “Far from Heaven” (except the relationship is between a white woman and a black man). People with dark skin often appear to have particularly white teeth, because of the contrast between their teeth and skin. The girl is all hot and bothered and ready to have sex. According to Deal, the main inspiration for the song was the film Crimes of the Heart, in which a married woman falls in love with a black teenager and the song “Gigantic” is credited to Mrs John Murphy (Kim Deal’s pseudonym at the time of Come On Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa as an ironic feminist joke).\\n\\nThe song’s voyeuristic lyrics mostly revolve around a woman’s observation of an attractive black man making love to another woman, culminating in the oddly light-hearted but sexual chorus: “Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic / A big, big love”.\\n\\n\\n\\nOddly enough, the “big black mess” line wasn’t written by Kim Deal, but a friend of her husband’s named John Draper, who was writing random phrases down to help Deal flesh out the song. Out of his list, she kept “big black mess” and “hunk of love”. “A good chord progression, very Lou Reed influenced. I’d had the word ‘gigantic’ in my mind just because the chord progression seemed very big to me.” – Black Francis\\n\\nGigantic can also be the guy’s dick, of course.',\n",
       " 76810: 'People often talk as though doing drugs and partying hard will have detrimental health effects, but it was worth it. James is saying that he doesn’t care and would give up another five years of life if it meant having this good of a time. He’d rather have guaranteed happiness in his 20s and 30s than the possibility of living to 80 or 90. Murphy reminisces on the good old days and wishes he could see all the friends he used to have in his youth. It’s clear by now that the song is about growing old and throwing a party like one used to in their youth. As an adult, your life is full of responsibilities and a party like this is very rare.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou lose friends over time – it isn’t like the college days when you had more friends than you could count. It’s hard to hold on to the social circles we once had.\\n\\nWhere are YOUR friends tonight? It’s at this point in the story where you finally have a moment of clarity with your life. It’s morning, everyone is hungover, girls have their panties and bras off from horny guys, and you can’t believe people would act like this…\\n\\n…until you realize that you were one of those people, and unlike a regular moment of clarity where it occurs early in life, it’s too late to change your ways. He got into an argument with someone before the trip, and he’s rereading it. He said something he didn’t mean, and he probably wishes he could take it back now. And although he takes the trip to relax and get away from his friends, he only ends up missing them. Here he may be expressing how insignificant it is to stress about coming off negatively in past interviews. This may be a note to simply move on.\\n\\nThis is about if the tour or band fails, you can do it yourself, ‘you can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown’ – maybe a wry comment about James and machinery, all these fancy new computers and technology. But of course on a tour you rely on other people, you forget how to cope. Murphy has no children, which is why the possibility that he’s the “You” of this story doesn’t make sense here. But this line could also mean that Murphy is old enough to be a dad despite the fact that he has no children. Or he might have been interchanging the “You” and “I” of the story throughout the entire song, as in “When I say ‘you’ I really mean ‘me’”.\\n\\n\\n\\nMurphy and his friend have to go their separate ways. One of them hops on a plane. Once again, he points out that they’re getting old, they’re getting tired, but they want to make the most of life. And looking back is more exciting than looking forward, so instead of taking the time to sleep on the plane, Murphy (or his friend) reminisces (with either a cell phone or a laptop in hand looking at old texts/e-mails) on all the things he said in the past. And if he gets bound to his obligations, at least he can still reminisce. This like refers to Murphy’s life on the road as a musician. If he fails on tour and makes a fool of himself, he always has this to return back to. (party with his old friends) At this point in his career James Murphy feels like he and his bandmates are salesmen, only going on tour to sell a record. He talks about this more in his Sound Opinions interview\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60aAdCztRBY&list=RDyYCz06bS380&index=2\\n\\nThis may also be a reference to the play/film Glenngarry Glen Ross, where a band of real estate salesmen commit a series of unethical and illegal acts in desperate attempts to keep their jobs. At the time of making the record this track is on “Sound of Silver” Murphy had grown tired of the “make a record and tour then make another record and tour” life, he literally meant this could be the last record he makes as LCD. The use of “blowing” here seems to suggest that the ability to afford and take a lavish vacation through the vineyards of the Loire valley feels meaningless if you’re not able to spend that time with your friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis captures the essence of a mid-life crisis – the listless futility of seeking adventure to recapture the spontaneity of youth. They spent so much time trying to rush and get everything they wanted to accomplish done while they were still young. And by doing that, they missed out on lots of friendship opportunities.\\n\\nThe situation’s gone from a steady party to a question of position, a midlife crisis on the sofas of a Harvard graduate. He’s not seeing any upside to this situation. The party is dissolving. So are their lives. They turn 45 years old just as fast as the 45 records they’re spinning. So he’s saying…\\n\\nLet’s pretend we’re having fun as much fun as we used to even though we can’t keep up with our old selves.” There’s an age theme that starts here. The exact age is never mentioned but it’s definitely mid-life and given the proceeding line you could venture to say it’s somewhere around 35 years old. They realise they are falling behind “the plan” for life and need to play catch-up.\\n\\nFirst 5 years = get a family, job, life plan.\\n\\nNext 5 years = try to get back to the days before you had a family, job, and life plan: back when you had fun. A friend decides to crank out all the stops and put the party into full swing. The party’s looking pretty lame, but it just started, so they’re hoping things will get better. They try to make conversation, but there’s nothing for them to talk about. They end up talking about the weather\\n\\n\\n\\nIt could also be more along the lines of “If you’re going to let your concerns about being hot or cold or getting rained on get in the way of this night, don’t bother showing up.”  Fits with the motif of the previous two lines, as well as the “stay up until dawn” attitude of the fourth verse. There are a lot of people at the party. All of them are Murphy’s old friends that he’s hoping to stay up late and party and reconnect with. The charts they are checking are the top 40 music charts. Murphy and friends decide to throw a spontaneous party like they used to back in the day, but when they look at the charts to decide what popular songs they are going to play for the party, they don’t recognize any of them. The thing that they “start to figure out” is that they are getting old and out of touch. The “it” which starts is a party. The “your house” is the house of a friend. A reference to a Pink Floyd song, “Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun”. It shows how old they are that they listened to Pink Floyd when they were at their most popular.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RbXIMZmVv8\\n\\nThey start “partying hard” to old songs, determined to make this party a success, whereas, back in the day, things would just fall into place. If the party was bound to be a bad one, they used to just abandon it. But now they’re getting old, and they need things to work. …No, he can’t afford to do that. He has responsibilities and he can’t allow himself to get drunk and pass out. People are counting on him, so he can’t party like he wants to.\\n\\nRemembering (and honoring) our sober selves, we trudge on to meet the next day.  This line is good enough to be used in AA meetings!\\n\\nAlso this is saying that he is using the memory of his younger self to keep on partying. To “keep him on his feet” Late night ‘blackout’ strolls home from the bar are some of the most poignant, inspiring, and epic moments in our lives.  Sometimes it’s even difficult to motivate yourself to continue walking.\\n\\nIf he gets hung over into the next day…',\n",
       " 63984: \"A popular theory is that the young, naive narrator is engaged and the older, more experienced “charming” man is advising him to call it off.\\n\\nAnother theory is that the song is a reference to The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, and these lines represent Dorian’s engagement. In the book, Dorian is talked out of the engagement by Lord Henry (the “charming” man). This is a quote from the 1972 movie Sleuth.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne possible explanation for this quote is that the narrator is essentially a nobody and this “charming” man is enticing him with a life of luxury. Why should he walk back when this nice man is offering him a ride? This is an invitation to the luxurious side of life, in contrast to an uncomfortable bicycle which presumably isn’t a smooth ride. The wider message is: why bother with the complexities of life when being a passive ‘pasenger’ is so easy? As the narrator’s sitting on the side of the road a “charming” man, noticing him in distress with a punctured bicycle tire, pulls up in a nice car and offers him a ride. It’s unclear whether he means charming as in pleasant or attractive, but this will come up again throughout the song. The man says this in response to the narrator’s excuse. This appears to be a pickup line, and it now becomes clear why the man offered him a ride. Rather than get uncomfortable, the narrator takes the compliment. Morrissey’s sexuality has always been questioned, and many of The Smiths' songs contain sexually ambiguous lyrics. This is likely influenced by A Taste Of Honey by Shelagh Delany within which Jo, the protagonist, uses “I haven’t got any clothes to wear, for one thing.” as the reason that she doesn’t go out dancing in the evenings like the others do. Morrissey is very influenced by the play and references to the film can also be found in “Reel Around The Fountain”, “This Night Has Opened My Eyes” and “You’ve Got Everything Now” to name a few.\\nThis quote, at first impression, indicates that the protagonist (either Jo or the narrator of the song) indicates that they are poorer than their peers or possibly given less money by parents however it is also likely that this reasoning is not to be taken as literal – the narrator may not feel comfortable in certain social situations and therefore uses excuses that imply economic inadequacy as opposed to the honest social inadequacy. The narrator is out on a bicycle ride in the country, and one of his tires gets punctured. Not being prepared for this, he dramatically (and facetiously) ponders his fate—“will Nature make a man of me yet?” is like him exclaiming, “will I make it out of here in this wilderness!?”. The accident becomes the setup for the subsequent events of the narrative, prompting his chance encounter with the “charming man”.\\n\\nMorrissey provides a contemporary look on an allusion to Spartan mythology. Spartan boys were expected to join the army and fight like men from a very young age. Those who were not capable or adequate soldiers were left on a hill to die, similar to the position the narrator is in. Upon doing this Morrissey solidifies the theme of anti-machismo.\\n\\nIn 2013’s Autobiography, Morrissey relates appearing as an extra on television’s Coronation Street as a young boy in 1973 Manchester. Just before hitting the set for his brief, non-speaking role, his “shagpile moptop is shorn to the bone without my consultation.” When filming begins, he is “ordered to cycle through a conventional industrial scene of the frozen north” – a setting which he then summarizes as, “a punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate.”\",\n",

This part showcases that this song has a dual meaning: it both refers to a “beast”, the dragon, but also the “beast” in the heart of the singer. The song is to be heard as an allegory of the growl, this way of singing being the “evidence” that there is a “beast” within the singer.',\n",

Many years ago, Claudio and his tour manager (who was in the military at the time) were together looking for a Wal-Mart. Claudio spotted a Wal-Mart miles away, and his tour manager told him, “Good eye, sniper!” He knew that he had to use that line in a song in the future.

       " 691212: 'There is rage the human side of the narrator feels towards this thing that is tearing him apart. This “demon” feeds off the rage, gaining strength and using it to fuel its murderous intentions. Being a human but having this “demon” within him gives the narrator a unique perspective. He doesn’t sleep or experience time in the way a typical person would. His humanness is dying as the evil spirit takes more and more control. He has this evil within him which is awakening and growing in strength. It is tearing his psyche apart from the inside out. Another recurring theme on the album, also found in “The Bad Thing” The idea that the stars decide what happens is just a poetic way of saying “fate”. Fate burns from “the inside out” because he has taken his fate into his own hands. Having just decided to cast off the cult (The Scourge) and start taking his life into his own hands (Alpha), he feels purposeless without religion to tell him what to do.',\n",

These two lines are seemingly inconsequential. But this stanza acts as a means of transition from track one to track two. This line further solidifies the circus atmosphere as well as the album’s literal introduction by calling to mind the job of an announcer. In fact, based on the third-person wording of this stanza and the album’s concept, these lines are probably intended to be delivered by some unidentified persona (even though Paul McCartney is the one singing them). The joyful repetition of this refrain and subsequent proclamations call to mind a circus atmosphere and are delivered in a manner reminiscent of an announcer at a show.\\n\\nHistory reports that Paul wrote this song and sang the lead (even though all Beatles tracks are credited to Lennon-McCartney) but these lines are prominently sung by John Lennon. According to unofficial sources, “it was twenty years ago today” refers to the death of Aleister Crowley twenty years prior to the release of Sgt. Pepper’s, but this is not a verifiable fact, however interesting it may be.\\n\\nIt is perhaps most likely that Paul simply liked the way these lyrics sounded as an introduction.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWriMsTALF4 At the time of the recording of Sgt. Pepper’s, The Beatles could be described as having entered a collective state of disillusionment. They had just decided to quit playing live (due to backlash following controversial remarks made by John Lennon) and they had just released their seventh and arguably their greatest album to date: Revolver.\\n\\nBack in February of 1964, Newsweek Magazine said that the lyrics of The Beatles were “a catastrophe,” and that their music “almost disastrous”–three years later with the release of Sgt. Pepper’s this same magazine was comparing them to poets such as T.S. Eliot, Wordsworth and Tennyson.\\n\\nThe dichotomy between such acute criticism and acclaim resulted in The Beatles—and particularly Paul McCartney—feeling that the best way for them to rise from the ashes would be to create music under new aliases and win over the world with charm, grace and a little help from their friends. There’s even a wacky comedy about the Fictional band starring: Peter Frampton, Aerosmith, and more! The song and concept are beloved by Beatles fans everywhere and many other famous artists have covered the song including: Jimi Hendrix, U2, and even Bill Cosby!\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUlv5FCqpeo\\n\\nFun Fact: Jimi Hendrix bought the album on the day of its release and managed to learn the song in 3 days–opening his June 4th concert with it. Turns out, George and Paul were in attendance. More specifically the name was derived from a musing on the letters “S” and “P” as McCartney recalls how the name developed:\\n\\n“Me and Mal often bantered words about which led to the rumour that he thought of the name Sergeant Pepper, but I think it would be much more likely that it was me saying, ‘Think of names.’ We were having our meal and they had those little packets marked ‘S’ and ‘P’. Mal said, ‘What’s that mean? Oh, salt and pepper.’ We had a joke about that. So I said, ‘Sergeant Pepper,’ just to vary it, ‘Sergeant Pepper, salt and pepper,’ an aural pun, not mishearing him but just playing with the words.” The audience featured in this song is not in real time, in fact they weren’t even listening to the Beatles!\\n\\nThey were taken from George Martin’s early 60’s recording of the live stage show “Beyond The Fringe” McCartney came up with the idea that for their next album, The Beatles should play the part of a different, fictional band, on the way back from a holiday in Kenya.\\n\\n“I thought it would be nice to lose our identities, to submerge ourselves in the persona of a fake group. We would make up all the culture around it and collect all our heroes in one place. So I thought, a typical stupid-sounding name for a Dr. Hook’s Medicine Show and Traveling Circus kind of thing would be ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s Club\"\\n\\nBut the album was initially going to be called “One Down – Six To Go” Alluding to the amount of albums they had to produce to fulfill their contract with EMI As well as the concept and lyrics being by McCartney, he also played lead guitar on this track. This trend of McCartney performing several instruments on his tracks was one that would intensify later into the band’s career, as he was a perfectionist that would only be satisfied with a recording that perfectly fit his musical vision. This caused frequent arguments with George Harrison, who took a much slower-paced, methodical approach to composition. Billy Shears is an alias of Ringo Starr’s. “Sgt.

       " 3057624: 'Life is hard. Life sucks a lot. It throws you curve balls and sometimes they hit you in the face. And, “ We’re all broken pieces floating by.”, everyone’s just floating through, trying to be the best person that they can be, the best versions of themselves, but everyone goes through the pain, everyone goes through the heartache, everyone goes through loss. And it’s just, I think, an every day person trying to figure out how to handle that. That’s the best parts that everyone hides about themselves. You put on this costume when you go out, you put on this armor meeting new people or meeting a potential love interest. Because you’re scared of rejection. Everyone is. You don’t wanna get told no, you don’t wanna get shut down, it hurts. And meeting someone and being able to crack those walls down and really getting to know somebody, that’s what that is. That’s like the best parts about you are hidden and like you get glimpses of it with people you meet immediately and whatever, but it’s like tearing the exterior out and getting to know the real person and sometimes you get lucky. That stems from cracking those walls down, on yourself with other people, and letting yourself be vulnerable. It’s missing from a lot of people. Because I think that it’s been scared out of a lot of people, I think with social media and stuff. It’s cooler to not give a fuck. It’s cooler to not care. It’s like relationships now-a-days, dating now-a-days, the whole culture is just who can care less. Who can give a fuck less. I think the pre-chorus bit there definitely touches back to what I was saying with, “I like that you’re lonely, lonely like me.” That stems from more of my insecurity of being feeling alone in a crowded room, like surrounded in parties like that. I sometimes come off as like charismatic and confident, but in my soul, in my head, I walk into a new place, I’m terrified. Because the first thought in my head is, “ These people don’t like me, these people don’t want me here. I shouldn’t be here, I need to leave.” And that’s where that came from. I am so bad at talking to people when I’m sober, and that part literally just getting the courage to chat up a girl that I might be interested in or whatever, it’s that liquid courage or whatever it is. We’ve all been to a million of those parties, and it’s just the struggle, especially being in Los Angeles and living in New York City before that, the sense of connection is just an absolute thing. And that’s not to sound petty or whatever, it is, but the object of connection and actually diving deeper than this superficial aspect of what social media has become and whatever. And wanting and longing for that connection with another person on a deeper level than just who are you. I wanna know how are you. It’s such a lost thing now-a-days, and it’s sad that everything’s like very surface. In relationships, in friendships, feeling like you’re alone in a crowded room is… It’s just such a common thing for a lot of people, I think.  I think that stemmed from a relationship I was in. I was so loved by the other person but I couldn’t shake the constant feeling alone all the time. Even same thing with my friends, and I’ll be out. There’s a constant feeling in the back of my head or this little voice that’s just like, “You don’t fit in here, this isn’t where you’re supposed to be,” whatever. Even though, I’m surrounded by the best people in the whole world, my best friends in the world. I love them to death, but there’s always that little voice, like, “No, you’re gonna fuck this up.” Collins: When I wrote that lyric, what triggered it, I think was just the reality of the atate of America we’re in right now. “I like that you’re broken, broken like me.” We’re finally in an age where the conversation about mental health is happening and it’s taken too long. And I think that, “I like that you’re broken, broken like me,” everyone has felt that way. Everyone has had a shitty go at one point. Everyone has gone through a break-up that’s crushed them. There’s not one person in the world that hasn’t felt down. Everyone’s a little bit broken. Even the happiest guy in the world has had a bad day before.',\n",
       " 308923: \"A score – being the number twenty – perhaps this refers to a crew of twenty, and “the milky seas” referring to the Milky Way, as this song is about space travel. The subject of the song now has his whole life to live, but without all the people, including his wife, that he knew when he left Earth. “pity me” doesn’t fit the rhyme scheme of the song, and the guitar temporarily halts on this line. This highlights the desperation the subject feels. This implies that, since the events told in the song, humanity has colonized other planets and moved away from Earth So many years have passed during the volunteers' trip that even the narrator’s grandchildren are in the past, likely dead. The protagonist has returned to Earth looking for someone but instead found one of their great descendants due to all the time that has passed.\\n\\nBrian May mentioned this line in a 1983 interview, saying,\\n\\nHe’s aged a year and they’ve aged 100 years. So, instead of coming back to his wife, he comes back to his daughter and he can see his wife in his daughter. Here, the “years” refer to the hundred or more years of time separating the narrator from his partner. The lyric has a sadder connotation now, since the volunteer thought he would come back to Earth where his love was waiting, but he is even farther away from her than he originally thought; he is now trapped in time, not space. Thought this sounds similar to the first two lines of the first verse the subtle implication is that the explorers had been gone for at least one hundred years. At first hearing, it sounds as though they are returning in the same year. However, this means the volunteers left and returned on the journey in years that ended in the number ‘39, e.g. 2039 to 2239. Due to the effects of time dilation at near light-speed travel, the volunteers feel like they have only been gone for a relatively short time – but a much longer time has passed on Earth. Their friends and family are all dead or very old. The previous line “In the land that our grandchildren knew” suggests that at least three generations have passed since the colonists first left the earth.\",\n",
       " 108832: 'This song is the only one in the album which features Hetfield’s soloing by himself. He brings a lot of melody and this helps to create the song’s emotional feel. As James Hetfield talked with his girlfriend (and future wife) Francesca on the phone, he noodled the guitar neck with the free hand and came to the simple chords which provided the song intro. There’s a new challenge or obstacle that the couple will face each day. James actually means the words he says, it’s just not some rambling rhetoric. Hetfield exclaims that even though people would tell him that he was working too hard or devoting too much time on his band, that he was determined to make the best out of it. An urge to his fans to keep an open mind about Metallica’s work in ‘The Black Album’. Hetfield is saying to trust his and the band’s decision to foray into a new musical direction.  He optimistically knows that he will find that trust in you. At the time of writing this song, Metallica were in the studios at Presidio in San Francisco recording the Black album.\\n\\nThe band had reassembled for the first time in a long time, and this album marked a new beginning – where the band members had matured.\\n\\nJames Hetfield had taken classical guitar lessons during their downtime, and between recording he would sit down with his acoustic guitar and play around with riffs.\\n\\n“Nothing Else Matters” and the opening few verses came out where James sat down on the phone with his girlfriend between recording sessions, he had one hand on the phone and only the other free which he used to compose the opening and first few verses.\\n\\n“Nothing Else Matters” is about the most profound feeling a musician is forced to host and face. There’s a trade-off in efforts of making a living as most of people do and to dedicate and risk yourself to be a successful musician where few people is able to achieve. The band members trusted each other’s work, and most importantly, the feeling that they were doing great music at that time and something big was about to happen. Even if they were wrong, it didn’t matter, simply because they knew that this was their choice of living. Open your mind, trust your feelings, follow your heart and don’t be trapped by other people’s dogmas. One of the most beautiful messages I’ve ever listen to.\\n\\nHetfield considered it a personal song and didn’t want it to appear on the album, but Ulrich convinced him otherwise.\\n\\nLater on, Hetfield said he forgot what the song was about, but that was post Black-tour and post-rehab, there is footage in two different Metallica touring documentaries showing Hetfield on the phone at the time he composed “Nothing Else Matters.” Metallica doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of them and what other people are doing, which is why they alienated many of their hardcore fans by making a simpler, more commercial album. But they knew that this was the right move, and you can’t argue with the numbers. James Hetfield is claiming that this is the first time he is pouring his heart out in song to show his vulnerabilties. Although that is debateable There is a certain Metallica lifestyle, originally documented in the classic track “Motorbreath.”'}"
